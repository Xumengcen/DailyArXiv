| **[A Text-Image Fusion Method with Data Augmentation Capabilities for Referring Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12482v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data, especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation. However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/11yxk/MedSeg_EarlyFusion.</p></details> |  |

Comprising 27,816 indoor layouts across 18 prevalent room types and a library of 29,215 high-fidelity 3D object assets, IL3D is enriched with instance-level natural language annotations to support robust multimodal learning for vision-language tasks. We establish rigorous benchmarks to evaluate LLM-driven scene generation. Experimental results show that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs on IL3D significantly improves generalization and surpasses the performance of SFT on other datasets. IL3D offers flexible multimodal data export capabilities, including point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, multiview images, depth maps, normal maps, and semantic masks, enabling seamless adaptation to various visual tasks. As a versatile and robust resource, IL3D significantly advances research in 3D scene generation and embodied intelligence, by providing high-fidelity scene data to support environment perception tasks of embodied agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages main paper; 15 pages references and appendix</p></details> |
| **[TalkCuts: A Large-Scale Dataset for Multi-Shot Human Speech Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07249v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present TalkCuts, a large-scale dataset designed to facilitate the study of multi-shot human speech video generation. Unlike existing datasets that focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, TalkCuts offers 164k clips totaling over 500 hours of high-quality human speech videos with diverse camera shots, including close-up, half-body, and full-body views. The dataset includes detailed textual descriptions, 2D keypoints and 3D SMPL-X motion annotations, covering over 10k identities, enabling multimodal learning and evaluation. As a first attempt to showcase the value of the dataset, we present Orator, an LLM-guided multi-modal generation framework as a simple baseline, where the language model functions as a multi-faceted director, orchestrating detailed specifications for camera transitions, speaker gesticulations, and vocal modulation. This architecture enables the synthesis of coherent long-form videos through our integrated multi-modal video generation module. Extensive experiments in both pose-guided and audio-driven settings show that training on TalkCuts significantly enhances the cinematographic coherence and visual appeal of generated multi-shot speech videos. We believe TalkCuts provides a strong foundation for future work in controllable, multi-shot speech video generation and broader multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://talkcuts.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Alignment and Fusion: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17040v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in multimodal alignment and fusion within the field of machine learning, driven by the increasing availability and diversity of data modalities such as text, images, audio, and video. Unlike previous surveys that often focus on specific modalities or limited fusion strategies, our work presents a structure-centric and method-driven framework that emphasizes generalizable techniques. We systematically categorize and analyze key approaches to alignment and fusion through both structural perspectives -- data-level, feature-level, and output-level fusion -- and methodological paradigms -- including statistical, kernel-based, graphical, generative, contrastive, attention-based, and large language model (LLM)-based methods, drawing insights from an extensive review of over 260 relevant studies. Furthermore, this survey highlights critical challenges such as cross-modal misalignment, computational bottlenecks, data quality issues, and the modality gap, along with recent efforts to address them. Applications ranging from social media analysis and medical imaging to emotion recognition and embodied AI are explored to illustrate the real-world impact of robust multimodal systems. The insights provided aim to guide future research toward optimizing multimodal learning systems for improved scalability, robustness, and generalizability across diverse domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Jigsaw-R1: A Study of Rule-based Visual Reinforcement Learning with Jigsaw Puzzles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23590v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces unique challenges and potential deviations from findings in text-only domains, particularly for perception-heavy tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL, using jigsaw puzzles as a structured experimental framework. Jigsaw puzzles offer inherent ground truth, adjustable difficulty, and demand complex decision-making, making them ideal for this study. Our research reveals several key findings: \textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random guessing on the simplest jigsaw puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL and its potential in multimodal learning.

| **[Cattle-CLIP: A Multimodal Framework for Cattle Behaviour Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09203v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health, productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6 dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking, standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows. Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding, drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, submitted to Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</p></details> |
| **[Looking to Learn: Token-wise Dynamic Gating for Low-Resource Vision-Language Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08470v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3) auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision, favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words. While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability and performance even under severe constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the EMNLP 2025 BabyLM Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Provably Robust Adaptation for Language-Empowered Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08659v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP, have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification (\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for real-world applications.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Expressive and Scalable Quantum Fusion for Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06938v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The aim of this paper is to introduce a quantum fusion mechanism for multimodal learning and to establish its theoretical and empirical potential. The proposed method, called the Quantum Fusion Layer (QFL), replaces classical fusion schemes with a hybrid quantum-classical procedure that uses parameterized quantum circuits to learn entangled feature interactions without requiring exponential parameter growth. Supported by quantum signal processing principles, the quantum component efficiently represents high-order polynomial interactions across modalities with linear parameter scaling, and we provide a separation example between QFL and low-rank tensor-based methods that highlights potential quantum query advantages. In simulation, QFL consistently outperforms strong classical baselines on small but diverse multimodal tasks, with particularly marked improvements in high-modality regimes. These results suggest that QFL offers a fundamentally new and scalable approach to multimodal fusion that merits deeper exploration on larger systems.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Centering Emotion Hotspots: Multimodal Local-Global Fusion and Cross-Modal Alignment for Emotion Recognition in Conversations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08606v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is hard because discriminative evidence is sparse, localized, and often asynchronous across modalities. We center ERC on emotion hotspots and present a unified model that detects per-utterance hotspots in text, audio, and video, fuses them with global features via Hotspot-Gated Fusion, and aligns modalities using a routed Mixture-of-Aligners; a cross-modal graph encodes conversational structure. This design focuses modeling on salient spans, mitigates misalignment, and preserves context. Experiments on standard ERC benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, with ablations confirming the contributions of HGF and MoA. Our results point to a hotspot-centric view that can inform future multimodal learning, offering a new perspective on modality fusion in ERC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[ImplicitQA: Going beyond frames towards Implicit Video Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21742v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Question Answering (VideoQA) has made significant strides by leveraging multimodal learning to align visual and textual modalities. However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly focus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions, objects, and events directly observable within individual frames or short clips. In contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and narrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately omit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, relationships across discontinuous frames with disjoint visual contexts. Humans naturally excel at such implicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context to construct coherent narratives. Yet current benchmarks fail to capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this gap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test VideoQA models on human-like implicit reasoning. ImplicitQA comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs drawn from 1K high-quality creative video clips covering 15 genres across 7 decades of content. Questions are systematically categorized into nine key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth and proximity, viewpoint and visibility, motion and trajectory, causal and motivational reasoning, social interactions, physical context, and inferred counting. These annotations are deliberately challenging, crafted by authors, validated through multiple annotators, and benchmarked against human performance to ensure high quality. Our extensive evaluations on 11 leading VideoQA models reveals consistent and significant performance degradation, underscoring their reliance on surface-level visual cues and highlighting the difficulty of implicit reasoning. https://huggingface.co/datasets/ucf-crcv/ImplicitQA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unsupervised Speech Recognition at the Syllable-Level](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03639v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training speech recognizers with unpaired speech and text -- known as unsupervised speech recognition (UASR) -- is a crucial step toward extending ASR to low-resource languages in the long-tail distribution and enabling multimodal learning from non-parallel data. However, existing approaches based on phones often rely on costly resources such as grapheme-to-phoneme converters (G2Ps) and struggle to generalize to languages with ambiguous phoneme boundaries due to training instability. In this paper, we address both challenges by introducing a syllable-level UASR framework based on masked language modeling, which avoids the need for G2P and the instability of GAN-based methods. Our approach achieves up to a 40\% relative reduction in character error rate (CER) on LibriSpeech and generalizes effectively to Mandarin, a language that has remained particularly difficult for prior methods. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latency-aware Multimodal Federated Learning over UAV Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01717v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates federated multimodal learning (FML) assisted by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a focus on minimizing system latency and providing convergence analysis. In this framework, UAVs are distributed throughout the network to collect data, participate in model training, and collaborate with a base station (BS) to build a global model. By utilizing multimodal sensing, the UAVs overcome the limitations of unimodal systems, enhancing model accuracy, generalization, and offering a more comprehensive understanding of the environment. The primary objective is to optimize FML system latency in UAV networks by jointly addressing UAV sensing scheduling, power control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource management. To address the computational complexity of our latency minimization problem, we propose an efficient iterative optimization algorithm combining block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, which provides high-quality approximate solutions. We also present a theoretical convergence analysis for the UAV-assisted FML framework under a non-convex loss function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our FML framework outperforms existing approaches in terms of system latency and model training performance under different data settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Balancing Multimodal Training Through Game-Theoretic Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07335v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning holds promise for richer information extraction by capturing dependencies across data sources. Yet, current training methods often underperform due to modality competition, a phenomenon where modalities contend for training resources leaving some underoptimized. This raises a pivotal question: how can we address training imbalances, ensure adequate optimization across all modalities, and achieve consistent performance improvements as we transition from unimodal to multimodal data? This paper proposes the Multimodal Competition Regularizer (MCR), inspired by a mutual information (MI) decomposition designed to prevent the adverse effects of competition in multimodal training. Our key contributions are: 1) A game-theoretic framework that adaptively balances modality contributions by encouraging each to maximize its informative role in the final prediction 2) Refining lower and upper bounds for each MI term to enhance the extraction of both task-relevant unique and shared information across modalities. 3) Proposing latent space permutations for conditional MI estimation, significantly improving computational efficiency. MCR outperforms all previously suggested training strategies and simple baseline, clearly demonstrating that training modalities jointly leads to important performance gains on both synthetic and large real-world datasets. We release our code and models at https://github.com/kkontras/MCR.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[PhraseStereo: The First Open-Vocabulary Stereo Image Segmentation Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00818v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception, encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance of this work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to X-Sense Ego-Exo Sensing for Smart Mobility Workshop at ICCV 2025 Conference</p></details> |
| **[MultiFair: Multimodal Balanced Fairness-Aware Medical Classification with Dual-Level Gradient Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07328v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances. The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness learning methods.</p></details> | 10 Pages |
| **[MIDAS: Misalignment-based Data Augmentation Strategy for Imbalanced Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25831v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal models often over-rely on dominant modalities, failing to achieve optimal performance. While prior work focuses on modifying training objectives or optimization procedures, data-centric solutions remain underexplored. We propose MIDAS, a novel data augmentation strategy that generates misaligned samples with semantically inconsistent cross-modal information, labeled using unimodal confidence scores to compel learning from contradictory signals. However, this confidence-based labeling can still favor the more confident modality. To address this within our misaligned samples, we introduce weak-modality weighting, which dynamically increases the loss weight of the least confident modality, thereby helping the model fully utilize weaker modality. Furthermore, when misaligned features exhibit greater similarity to the aligned features, these misaligned samples pose a greater challenge, thereby enabling the model to better distinguish between classes. To leverage this, we propose hard-sample weighting, which prioritizes such semantically ambiguous misaligned samples. Experiments on multiple multimodal classification benchmarks demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms related baselines in addressing modality imbalance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[FishNet++: Analyzing the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models in marine biology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25564v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy. This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133 textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for morphological studies, and 119,399 bounding boxes for detection. By providing this comprehensive suite of annotations, our work facilitates the development and evaluation of specialized vision-language models capable of advancing aquatic science.</p></details> | 3 figures 8 tables |
| **[A TRIANGLE Enables Multimodal Alignment Beyond Cosine Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24734v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning plays a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence systems by incorporating information from multiple modalities to build a more comprehensive representation. Despite its importance, current state-of-the-art models still suffer from severe limitations that prevent the successful development of a fully multimodal model. Such methods may not provide indicators that all the involved modalities are effectively aligned. As a result, some modalities may not be aligned, undermining the effectiveness of the model in downstream tasks where multiple modalities should provide additional information that the model fails to exploit. In this paper, we present TRIANGLE: TRI-modAl Neural Geometric LEarning, the novel proposed similarity measure that is directly computed in the higher-dimensional space spanned by the modality embeddings. TRIANGLE improves the joint alignment of three modalities via a triangle-area similarity, avoiding additional fusion layers or pairwise similarities. When incorporated in contrastive losses replacing cosine similarity, TRIANGLE significantly boosts the performance of multimodal modeling, while yielding interpretable alignment rationales. Extensive evaluation in three-modal tasks such as video-text and audio-text retrieval or audio-video classification, demonstrates that TRIANGLE achieves state-of-the-art results across different datasets improving the performance of cosine-based methods up to 9 points of Recall@1.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[MAESTRO : Adaptive Sparse Attention and Robust Learning for Multimodal Dynamic Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25278v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From clinical healthcare to daily living, continuous sensor monitoring across multiple modalities has shown great promise for real-world intelligent decision-making but also faces various challenges. In this work, we introduce MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large (making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra- and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4% and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches, respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement. Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Neurips 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Learning Enhances Language Model Based Cell Embeddings for Low-Sample Single Cell Transcriptomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23543v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong ability in generating rich representations across domains such as natural language processing and generation, computer vision, and multimodal learning. However, their application in biomedical data analysis remains nascent. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is essential for dissecting cell subtype diversity in development and disease, but rare subtypes pose challenges for scaling laws. We present a computational framework that integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with LLMs to derive knowledge-informed gene embeddings. Highly expressed genes for each cell are mapped to NCBI Gene descriptions and embedded using models such as text-embedding-ada-002, BioBERT, and SciBERT. Applied to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which differ in vulnerability to glaucoma-related neurodegeneration, this strategy improves subtype classification, highlights biologically significant features, and reveals pathways underlying selective neuronal vulnerability. More broadly, it illustrates how LLM-derived embeddings can augment biological analysis under data-limited conditions and lay the groundwork for future foundation models in single-cell biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, modalities observed in the source environment may differ from the modalities observed in the target environment due to multiple factors, including cost, hardware failure, or the perceived informativeness of a given modality. This shift in missingness between the source and target environment has not been carefully studied. Naive estimation of the information gain associated with including an additional modality without accounting for missingness may result in improper estimates of that modality's value in the target environment. We formalize the problem of missingness, demonstrate its ubiquity, and show that the subsequent distribution shift results in bias when the missingness process is not explicitly accounted for. To address this issue, we introduce ICYM2I (In Case You Multimodal Missed It), a framework for the evaluation of predictive performance and information gain under missingness through inverse probability weighting-based correction. We demonstrate the importance of the proposed adjustment to estimate information gain under missingness on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16181v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown promise in medical imaging, combining complementary modalities like images and text. Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the downstream unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference, only the vision model is used, keeping overhead low while still benefiting from multimodal training without requiring paired data in the downstream dataset. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of per-dataset paired annotation or inference-time complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Multimodal Active Learning: Efficient Learning with Limited Paired Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03247v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active learning (AL) is a principled strategy to reduce annotation cost in data-hungry deep learning. However, existing AL algorithms focus almost exclusively on unimodal data, overlooking the substantial annotation burden in multimodal learning. We introduce the first framework for multimodal active learning with unaligned data, where the learner must actively acquire cross-modal alignments rather than labels on pre-aligned pairs. This setting captures the practical bottleneck in modern multimodal pipelines such as CLIP and SigLIP, where unimodal features are easy to obtain but high-quality alignment is costly. We develop a new algorithm that combines uncertainty and diversity principles in a modality-aware design, achieves linear-time acquisition, and applies seamlessly to both pool-based and streaming-based settings. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces multimodal annotation cost while preserving performance; for instance, on the ColorSwap dataset it cuts annotation requirements by up to $40\%$ without loss in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Current AI models rely on structural or target-based features but fail to incorporate the multimodal data necessary for accurate, clinically relevant predictions. Here, we introduce Madrigal, a multimodal AI model that learns from structural, pathway, cell viability, and transcriptomic data to predict drug-combination effects across 953 clinical outcomes and 21,842 compounds, including combinations of approved drugs and novel compounds in development. Madrigal uses an attention bottleneck module to unify preclinical drug data modalities while handling missing data during training and inference, a major challenge in multimodal learning. It outperforms single-modality methods and state-of-the-art models in predicting adverse drug interactions, and ablations show both modality alignment and multimodality are necessary. It captures transporter-mediated interactions and aligns with head-to-head clinical trial differences for neutropenia, anemia, alopecia, and hypoglycemia. In type 2 diabetes and MASH, Madrigal supports polypharmacy decisions and prioritizes resmetirom among safer candidates. Extending to personalization, Madrigal improves patient-level adverse-event prediction in a longitudinal EHR cohort and an independent oncology cohort, and predicts ex vivo efficacy in primary acute myeloid leukemia samples and patient-derived xenograft models. Madrigal links preclinical multimodal readouts to safety risks of drug combinations and offers a generalizable foundation for safer combination design.</p></details> |  |

However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain, multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets, OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the physical world.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://yangzhou24.github.io/OmniWorld/</p></details> |

In cold start, i.e., when interaction histories of users or items are not available, content-based recommender systems use side information instead. Hybrid recommender systems (HRSs) often employ multimodal learning to combine collaborative and side information, which we jointly refer to as modalities. Though HRSs can provide recommendations when some modalities are missing, their quality degrades. In this work, we utilize single-branch neural networks equipped with weight sharing, modality sampling, and contrastive loss to provide accurate recommendations even in missing modality scenarios by narrowing the modality gap. We compare these networks with multi-branch alternatives and conduct extensive experiments on three datasets. Six accuracy-based and four beyond-accuracy-based metrics help assess the recommendation quality for the different training paradigms and their hyperparameters in warm-start and missing modality scenarios. We quantitatively and qualitatively study the effects of these different aspects on bridging the modality gap. Our results show that single-branch networks achieve competitive performance in warm-start scenarios and are significantly better in missing modality settings. Moreover, our approach leads to closer proximity of an item's modalities in the embedding space. Our full experimental setup is available at https://github.com/hcai-mms/single-branch-networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Recommender Systems (TORS)</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel multimodal learning framework that integrates enhanced modalities dropout and contrastive learning to address real-world limitations such as modality imbalance and missingness. Our approach introduces learnable modality tokens for improving missingness-aware fusion of modalities and augments conventional unimodal contrastive objectives with fused multimodal representations. We validate our framework on large-scale clinical datasets for disease detection and prediction tasks, encompassing both visual and tabular modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in challenging and practical scenarios where only a single modality is available. Furthermore, we show its adaptability through successful integration with a recent CT foundation model. Our findings highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability of our approach for multimodal learning, offering a scalable, low-cost solution with significant potential for real-world clinical applications. The code is available at https://github.com/omron-sinicx/medical-modality-dropout.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |

We present ClassMind, an AI-driven classroom observation system that integrates generative AI and multimodal learning to analyze classroom artifacts (e.g., class recordings) and deliver timely, personalized feedback aligned with pedagogical practices. At its core is AVA-Align, an agent framework that analyzes long classroom video recordings to generate temporally precise, best-practice-aligned feedback to support teacher reflection and improvement. Our three-phase study involved participatory co-design with educators, development of a full-stack system, and field testing with teachers at different stages of practice. Teachers highlighted the system's usefulness, ease of use, and novelty, while also raising concerns about privacy and the role of human judgment, motivating deeper exploration of future human--AI coaching partnerships. This work illustrates how multimodal AI can scale expert coaching and advance teacher development.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods struggle to fully leverage the textual modality, relying on supervised pretrained models, which limits semantic extraction in unsupervised robotic environments, particularly with significant modality loss. These methods also tend to be computationally intensive, leading to high resource consumption in real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi Modal Mamba Enhanced Transformer (M3ET), a lightweight model designed for efficient multimodal learning, particularly on mobile platforms. By incorporating the Mamba module and a semantic-based adaptive attention mechanism, M3ET optimizes feature fusion, alignment, and modality reconstruction. Our experiments show that M3ET improves cross-task performance, with a 2.3 times increase in pretraining inference speed. In particular, the core VQA task accuracy of M3ET remains at 0.74, while the model's parameter count is reduced by 0.67. Although performance on the EQA task is limited, M3ET's lightweight design makes it well suited for deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Trainee Action Recognition through Interaction Analysis in CCATT Mixed-Reality Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17888v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examines how Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT) members are trained using mixed-reality simulations that replicate the high-pressure conditions of aeromedical evacuation. Each team - a physician, nurse, and respiratory therapist - must stabilize severely injured soldiers by managing ventilators, IV pumps, and suction devices during flight. Proficient performance requires clinical expertise and cognitive skills, such as situational awareness, rapid decision-making, effective communication, and coordinated task management, all of which must be maintained under stress. Recent advances in simulation and multimodal data analytics enable more objective and comprehensive performance evaluation. In contrast, traditional instructor-led assessments are subjective and may overlook critical events, thereby limiting generalizability and consistency. However, AI-based automated and more objective evaluation metrics still demand human input to train the AI algorithms to assess complex team dynamics in the presence of environmental noise and the need for accurate re-identification in multi-person tracking. To address these challenges, we introduce a systematic, data-driven assessment framework that combines Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) with Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA). We have developed a domain-specific CTA model for CCATT training and a vision-based action recognition pipeline using a fine-tuned Human-Object Interaction model, the Cascade Disentangling Network (CDN), to detect and track trainee-equipment interactions over time. These interactions automatically yield performance indicators (e.g., reaction time, task duration), which are mapped onto a hierarchical CTA model tailored to CCATT operations, enabling interpretable, domain-relevant performance evaluations.</p></details> |  |

Yet synchronized acoustic and phonological signals provide complementary context that can enrich visual information and improve precision. In this paper, we introduce VocSegMRI, a multimodal framework that integrates video, audio, and phonological inputs through cross-attention fusion for dynamic feature alignment. To further enhance cross-modal representation, we incorporate a contrastive learning objective that improves segmentation performance even when the audio modality is unavailable at inference. Evaluated on a sub-set of USC-75 rtMRI dataset, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Dice score of 0.95 and a 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD_95) of 4.20 mm, outperforming both unimodal and multimodal baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of cross-attention and contrastive learning to segmentation precision and robustness. These results highlight the value of integrative multimodal modeling for accurate vocal tract analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to ICASSP</p></details> |
| **[DeepInsert: Early Layer Bypass for Efficient and Performant Multimodal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19327v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hyperscaling of data and parameter count in transformer models is yielding diminishing performance improvement, especially when weighed against training costs. Such plateauing underlines a growing need for more efficient finetuning and inference, without sacrificing performance. This is particularly pressing for multimodal learning, where the overhead of processing multimodal tokens alongside language data often limits the practical viability of these systems. In parallel, advances in representation learning and interpretability have deepened our understanding of how such models process and encode information. Notably, recent work has uncovered implicit cross-modal alignment in the deeper layers of large pretrained models. Interestingly, this aligns with our own observations that models naturally defer most cross-modal token interactions to deeper stages of computation. Building on this, we propose a simple modification. Instead of concatenation with the language prompt at the start, we insert multimodal tokens directly into the middle, allowing them to entirely bypass the early layers. Our results with diverse modalities: 1) LLaVA \& BLIP for vision, 2) LTU for audio, and 3) MoLCA for molecular data, indicate that our method reduces computational costs during both training and inference, while at the very least, preserving, if not surpassing the performance of existing baselines. Our work has important implications for scaling and composing pretrained models in a resource-efficient manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Moon's Many Faces: A Single Unified Transformer for Multimodal Lunar Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05644v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning is an emerging research topic across multiple disciplines but has rarely been applied to planetary science. In this contribution, we propose a single, unified transformer architecture trained to learn shared representations between multiple sources like grayscale images, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), surface normals, and albedo maps. The architecture supports flexible translation from any input modality to any target modality. Our results demonstrate that our foundation model learns physically plausible relations across these four modalities. We further identify that image-based 3D reconstruction and albedo estimation (Shape and Albedo from Shading) of lunar images can be formulated as a multimodal learning problem. Our results demonstrate the potential of multimodal learning to solve Shape and Albedo from Shading and provide a new approach for large-scale planetary 3D reconstruction. Adding more input modalities in the future will further improve the results and enable tasks such as photometric normalization and co-registration.</p></details> | 48pages |

This need arises from the widespread influence and ease of sharing misinformation, which can lead to significant societal harm. Current methods often struggle with the dynamic and multimodal nature of short video content. This paper presents HFN, Heterogeneous Fusion Net, a novel multimodal framework that integrates video, audio, and text data to evaluate the authenticity of short video content. HFN introduces a Decision Network that dynamically adjusts modality weights during inference and a Weighted Multi-Modal Feature Fusion module to ensure robust performance even with incomplete data. Additionally, we contribute a comprehensive dataset VESV (VEracity on Short Videos) specifically designed for short video fake news detection. Experiments conducted on the FakeTT and newly collected VESV datasets demonstrate improvements of 2.71% and 4.14% in Marco F1 over state-of-the-art methods. This work establishes a robust solution capable of effectively identifying fake news in the complex landscape of short video platforms, paving the way for more reliable and comprehensive approaches in combating misinformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Words: Enhancing Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition with Non-Verbal Cues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15540v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Desire, as an intention that drives human behavior, is closely related to both emotion and sentiment. Multimodal learning has advanced sentiment and emotion recognition, but multimodal approaches specially targeting human desire understanding remain underexplored. And existing methods in sentiment analysis predominantly emphasize verbal cues and overlook images as complementary non-verbal cues. To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional Multimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition, which enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively capture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically, low-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for cross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into sub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to capture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an image-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal interaction at both local and global representations of image information. Additionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale image strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into sub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a multimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as emotion and sentiment recognition. Experimental results indicate consistent improvements over other state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Specifically, our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving F1-score improvements of 1.1% in desire understanding, 0.6% in emotion recognition, and 0.9% in sentiment analysis.

Unlike general-domain settings where more data often leads to better performance, naively scaling to large collections of noisy reports can plateau or even degrade model learning. We ask whether large language model (LLM) encoders can provide robust clinical representations that transfer across diverse styles and better guide image-text alignment. We introduce LLM2VEC4CXR, a domain-adapted LLM encoder for chest X-ray reports, and LLM2CLIP4CXR, a dual-tower framework that couples this encoder with a vision backbone. LLM2VEC4CXR improves clinical text understanding over BERT-based baselines, handles abbreviations and style variation, and achieves strong clinical alignment on report-level metrics. LLM2CLIP4CXR leverages these embeddings to boost retrieval accuracy and clinically oriented scores, with stronger cross-dataset generalization than prior medical CLIP variants. Trained on 1.6M CXR studies from public and private sources with heterogeneous and noisy reports, our models demonstrate that robustness -- not scale alone -- is the key to effective multimodal learning. We release models to support further research in medical image-text representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 2 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[Enriched text-guided variational multimodal knowledge distillation network (VMD) for automated diagnosis of plaque vulnerability in 3D carotid artery MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11924v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has attracted much attention in recent years due to its ability to effectively utilize data features from a variety of different modalities. Diagnosing the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques directly from carotid 3D MRI images is relatively challenging for both radiologists and conventional 3D vision networks. In clinical practice, radiologists assess patient conditions using a multimodal approach that incorporates various imaging modalities and domain-specific expertise, paving the way for the creation of multimodal diagnostic networks. In this paper, we have developed an effective strategy to leverage radiologists' domain knowledge to automate the diagnosis of carotid plaque vulnerability through Variation inference and Multimodal knowledge Distillation (VMD). This method excels in harnessing cross-modality prior knowledge from limited image annotations and radiology reports within training data, thereby enhancing the diagnostic network's accuracy for unannotated 3D MRI images. We conducted in-depth experiments on the dataset collected in-house and verified the effectiveness of the VMD strategy we proposed.</p></details> |  |

However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations, including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment. Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1) descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size, dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multilingual Diversity Improves Vision-Language Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16915v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Massive web-crawled image-text datasets lay the foundation for recent progress in multimodal learning. These datasets are designed with the goal of training a model to do well on standard computer vision benchmarks, many of which, however, have been shown to be English-centric (e.g., ImageNet). Consequently, existing data curation techniques gravitate towards using predominantly English image-text pairs and discard many potentially useful non-English samples. Our work questions this practice. Multilingual data is inherently enriching not only because it provides a gateway to learn about culturally salient concepts, but also because it depicts common concepts differently from monolingual data. We thus conduct a systematic study to explore the performance benefits of using more samples of non-English origins with respect to English vision tasks. By translating all multilingual image-text pairs from a raw web crawl to English and re-filtering them, we increase the prevalence of (translated) multilingual data in the resulting training set. Pre-training on this dataset outperforms using English-only or English-dominated datasets on ImageNet, ImageNet distribution shifts, image-English-text retrieval and on average across 38 tasks from the DataComp benchmark. On a geographically diverse task like GeoDE, we also observe improvements across all regions, with the biggest gain coming from Africa. In addition, we quantitatively show that English and non-English data are significantly different in both image and (translated) text space. We hope that our findings motivate future work to be more intentional about including multicultural and multilingual data, not just when non-English or geographically diverse tasks are involved, but to enhance model capabilities at large. All translated captions and metadata (language, CLIP score, etc.) are available on HuggingFace.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight paper</p></details> |

While these methods have shown strong detection performance, they often struggle to sustain robustness in real-world settings, particularly when facing code obfuscation and adversarial examples (AEs). Deep multimodal learning has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging the strengths of multiple feature types to enhance robustness and generalization. However, a systematic investigation of multimodal fusion for both accuracy and resilience remains underexplored. In this study, we propose DMLDroid, an Android malware detection based on multimodal fusion that leverages three different representations of malware features, including permissions & intents (tabular-based), DEX file representations (image-based), and API calls (graph-derived sequence-based). We conduct exhaustive experiments independently on each feature, as well as in combination, using different fusion strategies. Experimental results on the CICMalDroid 2020 dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach with the dynamic weighted fusion mechanism achieves high performance, reaching 97.98% accuracy and 98.67% F1-score on original malware detection. Notably, the proposed method maintains strong robustness, sustaining over 98% accuracy and 98% F1-score under both obfuscation and adversarial attack scenarios. Our findings highlight the benefits of multimodal fusion in improving both detection accuracy and robustness against evolving Android malware threats.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world scenarios, multimodal signals are susceptible to missing because of sensor failures and adverse weather conditions, which drastically deteriorates models' operation and performance. Generative models such as AutoEncoder (AE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are intuitive solutions aiming to reconstruct missing modality from available ones. Yet, their efficacy in remote sensing semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this paper, we first examine the limitations of existing generative approaches in handling the heterogeneity of multimodal remote sensing data. They inadequately capture semantic context in complex scenes with large intra-class and small inter-class variation. In addition, traditional generative models are susceptible to heavy dependence on the dominant modality, introducing bias that affects model robustness under missing modality conditions. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel Generative-Enhanced MultiModal learning Network (GEMMNet) with three key components: (1) Hybrid Feature Extractor (HyFEx) to effectively learn modality-specific representations, (2) Hybrid Fusion with Multiscale Awareness (HyFMA) to capture modality-synergistic semantic context across scales and (3) Complementary Loss (CoLoss) scheme to alleviate the inherent bias by encouraging consistency across modalities and tasks. Our method, GEMMNet, outperforms both generative baselines AE, cGAN (conditional GAN), and state-of-the-art non-generative approaches - mmformer and shaspec - on two challenging semantic segmentation remote sensing datasets (Vaihingen and Potsdam).

Explainable Multimodal Learning for Multi-Class Default Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10802v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, China's bond market has seen a surge in defaults amid regulatory reforms and macroeconomic volatility. Traditional machine learning models struggle to capture financial data's irregularity and temporal dependencies, while most deep learning models lack interpretability-critical for financial decision-making. To tackle these issues, we propose EMDLOT (Explainable Multimodal Deep Learning for Time-series), a novel framework for multi-class bond default prediction. EMDLOT integrates numerical time-series (financial/macroeconomic indicators) and unstructured textual data (bond prospectuses), uses Time-Aware LSTM to handle irregular sequences, and adopts soft clustering and multi-level attention to boost interpretability. Experiments on 1994 Chinese firms (2015-2024) show EMDLOT outperforms traditional (e.g., XGBoost) and deep learning (e.g., LSTM) benchmarks in recall, F1-score, and mAP, especially in identifying default/extended firms. Ablation studies validate each component's value, and attention analyses reveal economically intuitive default drivers. This work provides a practical tool and a trustworthy framework for transparent financial risk modeling.</p></details> |  |

To address this problem, we propose a multimodal end-to-end deep learning framework that combines dual-branch convolutional encoders for ECG and IEGM, semantic attention for cross-modal feature alignment, and a lightweight Transformer encoder for global dependency modeling. In addition, we introduce a new contrastive loss fucntion named Adaptive Global Class-Aware Contrastive Loss (AGCACL) to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separability through class prototypes and a global similarity matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study based on the Leipzig Heart Center pediatric/congenital ECG+IEGM dataset, for which we also provide a complete and reproducible preprocessing pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the overall best performance on this dataset, including 97.76\% Top-1 Accuracy, 94.08\% Macro Precision, 91.97\% Macro Recall, 92.97\% Macro F1, and 92.36\% Macro F2, with improvements of +13.64, +15.96, +19.82, and +19.44 percentage points over the strongest baseline in Macro Precision/Recall/F1/F2, respectively. These findings indicate that the framework significantly improves the detectability and robustness for minority arrhythmia classes, offering potential clinical value for rhythm screening, pre-procedural assessment, and postoperative follow-up in pediatric and congenital heart disease populations.</p></details> | 12pages, 10 figures |

We classify these approaches under a temporal-primary paradigm, which may overlook the unique and critical task-relevant information embedded in text modality like clinical reports, thus failing to fully leverage mutual benefits and complementarity of different modalities. To fill this gap, we propose a novel textual-temporal multimodal learning paradigm that enables either modality to serve as the primary while being enhanced by the other, thereby effectively capturing modality-specific information and fostering cross-modal interaction. In specific, we design MedualTime, a language model composed of dual adapters to implement temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. Within each adapter, lightweight adaptation tokens are injected into the top layers of LM to encourage high-level modality fusion. The shared LM pipeline by dual adapters not only achieves adapter alignment but also enables efficient fine-tuning, reducing computational resources. Empirically, MedualTime demonstrates superior performance on medical data, achieving notable improvements of 8% accuracy and 12% F1 in supervised settings. Furthermore, MedualTime's transferability is validated by few-shot label transfer experiments from coarse-grained to fine-grained medical data. https://github.com/start2020/MedualTime</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

While current transformer-based approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e, scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1) imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding. Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraMFedDHAR: Graph Based Multimodal Differentially Private Federated HAR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05671v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using multimodal sensor data remains challenging due to noisy or incomplete measurements, scarcity of labeled examples, and privacy concerns. Traditional centralized deep learning approaches are often constrained by infrastructure availability, network latency, and data sharing restrictions. While federated learning (FL) addresses privacy by training models locally and sharing only model parameters, it still has to tackle issues arising from the use of heterogeneous multimodal data and differential privacy requirements. In this article, a Graph-based Multimodal Federated Learning framework, GraMFedDHAR, is proposed for HAR tasks. Diverse sensor streams such as a pressure mat, depth camera, and multiple accelerometers are modeled as modality-specific graphs, processed through residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fused via attention-based weighting rather than simple concatenation. The fused embeddings enable robust activity classification, while differential privacy safeguards data during federated aggregation. Experimental results show that the proposed MultiModalGCN model outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN, with up to 2 percent higher accuracy in non-DP settings in both centralized and federated paradigms. More importantly, significant improvements are observed under differential privacy constraints: MultiModalGCN consistently surpasses MultiModalFFN, with performance gaps ranging from 7 to 13 percent depending on the privacy budget and setting. These results highlight the robustness of graph-based modeling in multimodal learning, where GNNs prove more resilient to the performance degradation introduced by DP noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[BadPromptFL: A Novel Backdoor Threat to Prompt-based Federated Learning in Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08040v3)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt-based tuning has emerged as a lightweight alternative to full fine-tuning in large vision-language models, enabling efficient adaptation via learned contextual prompts. This paradigm has recently been extended to federated learning settings (e.g., PromptFL), where clients collaboratively train prompts under data privacy constraints. However, the security implications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning remain largely unexplored, leaving a critical attack surface unaddressed. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{BadPromptFL}, the first backdoor attack targeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal contrastive models. In BadPromptFL, compromised clients jointly optimize local backdoor triggers and prompt embeddings, injecting poisoned prompts into the global aggregation process. These prompts are then propagated to benign clients, enabling universal backdoor activation at inference without modifying model parameters. Leveraging the contextual learning behavior of CLIP-style architectures, BadPromptFL achieves high attack success rates (e.g., \(>90\%\)) with minimal visibility and limited client participation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and aggregation protocols validate the effectiveness, stealth, and generalizability of our attack, raising critical concerns about the robustness of prompt-based federated learning in real-world deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Debiasing Medical Multimodal Representation Learning with Missing Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05615v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous clinical data into unified patient representations to support predictive modeling, which remains an essential yet challenging task in the medical data mining community. However, real-world medical datasets often suffer from missing modalities due to cost, protocol, or patient-specific constraints. Existing methods primarily address this issue by learning from the available observations in either the raw data space or feature space, but typically neglect the underlying bias introduced by the data acquisition process itself. In this work, we identify two types of biases that hinder model generalization: missingness bias, which results from non-random patterns in modality availability, and distribution bias, which arises from latent confounders that influence both observed features and outcomes. To address these challenges, we perform a structural causal analysis of the data-generating process and propose a unified framework that is compatible with existing direct prediction-based multimodal learning methods. Our method consists of two key components: (1) a missingness deconfounding module that approximates causal intervention based on backdoor adjustment and (2) a dual-branch neural network that explicitly disentangles causal features from spurious correlations. We evaluated our method in real-world public and in-hospital datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and causal insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

Imbalanced multimodal learning is one of the problems extensively studied in recent works and is typically mitigated by modulating the learning of each modality. However, we find that these methods typically hinder the dominant modality's learning to promote weaker modalities, which affects overall multimodal performance. We analyze the cause of this issue and highlight a commonly overlooked problem: optimization bias within networks. To address this, we propose Adaptive Intra-Network Modulation (AIM) to improve balanced modality learning. AIM accounts for differences in optimization state across parameters and depths within the network during modulation, achieving balanced multimodal learning without hindering either dominant or weak modalities for the first time. Specifically, AIM decouples the dominant modality's under-optimized parameters into Auxiliary Blocks and encourages reliance on these performance-degraded blocks for joint training with weaker modalities. This approach effectively prevents suppression of weaker modalities while enabling targeted optimization of under-optimized parameters to improve the dominant modality. Additionally, AIM assesses modality imbalance level across network depths and adaptively adjusts modulation strength at each depth. Experimental results demonstrate that AIM outperforms state-of-the-art imbalanced modality learning methods across multiple benchmarks and exhibits strong generalizability across different backbones, fusion strategies, and optimizers.</p></details> | 13pages,7 figures |
| **[Balanced Multimodal Learning: An Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02281v3)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning typically utilizes multimodal joint loss to integrate different modalities and enhance model performance. However, this joint learning strategy can induce modality imbalance, where strong modalities overwhelm weaker ones and limit exploitation of individual information from each modality and the inter-modality interaction information. Existing strategies such as dynamic loss weighting, auxiliary objectives and gradient modulation mitigate modality imbalance based on joint loss. These methods remain fundamentally reactive, detecting and correcting imbalance after it arises, while leaving the competitive nature of the joint loss untouched. This limitation drives us to explore a new strategy for multimodal imbalance learning that does not rely on the joint loss, enabling more effective interactions between modalities and better utilization of information from individual modalities and their interactions. In this paper, we introduce Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel strategy that abandons the conventional joint loss in favor of a proactive, sequential training scheme. UDI first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned representations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss. Furthermore, the dynamic adjustment of modality interactions allows the model to adapt to the task at hand, ensuring that each modality contributes optimally. By decoupling modality optimization and enabling directed information flow, UDI prevents domination by any single modality and fosters effective cross-modal feature learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that UDI outperforms existing methods in handling modality imbalance, leading to performance improvement in multimodal learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

The increasing availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios. Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS) classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions, confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE GLOBECOM 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we present the iterative design and evaluation of a gaze-based learning analytics dashboard for English Language Arts (ELA), developed through five studies involving teachers and students. Guided by user-centered design and data storytelling principles, we explored how gaze data can support reflection, formative assessment, and instructional decision-making. Our findings demonstrate that gaze analytics can be approachable and pedagogically valuable when supported by familiar visualizations, layered explanations, and narrative scaffolds. We further show how a conversational agent, powered by a large language model (LLM), can lower cognitive barriers to interpreting gaze data by enabling natural language interactions with multimodal learning analytics. We conclude with design implications for future EdTech systems that aim to integrate novel data modalities in classroom contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables, submitted to IUI2026</p></details> |

We propose Robult, a scalable framework designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled (PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2) a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at IJCAI 2025 in Montreal, Canada</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal learning of melt pool dynamics in laser powder bed fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03029v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multiple sensors are used for real-time monitoring in additive manufacturing, not all provide practical or reliable process insights. For example, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about subsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial settings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate with melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when used alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for predicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with low-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process. Our multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals, using an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a transfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool dynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the multimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone. Furthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using only absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging. This multimodal fusion approach enables cost-effective, real-time monitoring and has broad applicability in additive manufacturing.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

This article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning, which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning, which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities. Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7 for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58% respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under different missing types and rates.

| **[OpenVision 2: A Family of Generative Pretrained Visual Encoders for Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01644v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder (and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2 competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x (from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB, equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation models.</p></details> |  |

The majority of existing datasets are either manually annotated with an emphasis on a specific domain, query type, or answer type or are constrained by niche answer formats. In order to mitigate human-induced errors and guarantee lucidity, we implemented a multilingual LLM-assisted translation refinement pipeline. This dataset overcomes the issues of low-quality translations from multilingual sources. The dataset comprises 52,650 question-answer pairs across 4750+ images. Questions are classified into three distinct answer types: nominal (short descriptive), quantitative (numeric), and polar (yes/no). Bangla-Bayanno provides the most comprehensive open-source, high-quality VQA benchmark in Bangla, aiming to advance research in low-resource multimodal learning and facilitate the development of more inclusive AI systems.</p></details> |  |

However, the field lacks comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However, downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and benchmarking tools for the community</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is accessible at: https://github.com/peng-lab/hescape</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness remains unclear when additional modalities introduce more noise than complementary information. Existing approaches, such as the Partial Information Decomposition, struggle to scale beyond two modalities and lack the resolution needed for instance-level control. We propose Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW), a bi-level, non-parametric weighting framework that combines instance-level Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and modality-level mutual information (MI) to dynamically adjust modality importance during training. Our method does not require additional parameters and can be applied to an arbitrary number of modalities. Specifically, BTW computes per-example KL weights by measuring the divergence between each unimodal and the current multimodal prediction, and modality-wide MI weights by estimating global alignment between unimodal and multimodal outputs. Extensive experiments on sentiment regression and clinical classification demonstrate that our method significantly improves regression performance and multiclass classification accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Representation Learning Conditioned on Semantic Relations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17497v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal representation learning has advanced rapidly with contrastive models such as CLIP, which align image-text pairs in a shared embedding space. However, these models face limitations: (1) they typically focus on image-text pairs, underutilizing the semantic relations across different pairs. (2) they directly match global embeddings without contextualization, overlooking the need for semantic alignment along specific subspaces or relational dimensions; and (3) they emphasize cross-modal contrast, with limited support for intra-modal consistency. To address these issues, we propose Relation-Conditioned Multimodal Learning RCML, a framework that learns multimodal representations under natural-language relation descriptions to guide both feature extraction and alignment. Our approach constructs many-to-many training pairs linked by semantic relations and introduces a relation-guided cross-attention mechanism that modulates multimodal representations under each relation context. The training objective combines inter-modal and intra-modal contrastive losses, encouraging consistency across both modalities and semantically related samples. Experiments on different datasets show that RCML consistently outperforms strong baselines on both retrieval and classification tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging semantic relations to guide multimodal representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Gating Mechanism in Sparse MoE: Handling Arbitrary Modality Inputs with Confidence-Guided Gate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19525v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively managing missing modalities is a fundamental challenge in real-world multimodal learning scenarios, where data incompleteness often results from systematic collection errors or sensor failures. Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have the potential to naturally handle multimodal data, with individual experts specializing in different modalities. However, existing SMoE approach often lacks proper ability to handle missing modality, leading to performance degradation and poor generalization in real-world applications. We propose ConfSMoE to introduce a two-stage imputation module to handle the missing modality problem for the SMoE architecture by taking the opinion of experts and reveal the insight of expert collapse from theoretical analysis with strong empirical evidence. Inspired by our theoretical analysis, ConfSMoE propose a novel expert gating mechanism by detaching the softmax routing score to task confidence score w.r.t ground truth signal. This naturally relieves expert collapse without introducing additional load balance loss function. We show that the insights of expert collapse aligns with other gating mechanism such as Gaussian and Laplacian gate. The proposed method is evaluated on four different real world dataset with three distinct experiment settings to conduct comprehensive analysis of ConfSMoE on resistance to missing modality and the impacts of proposed gating mechanism.</p></details> |  |

With the advent of transcriptome profiling, multi-modal learning combining transcriptomics with histology offers more comprehensive information. However, existing multi-modal approaches are challenged by intrinsic multi-modal heterogeneity, insufficient multi-scale integration, and reliance on paired data, restricting clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose a disentangled multi-modal framework with four contributions: 1) To mitigate multi-modal heterogeneity, we decompose WSIs and transcriptomes into tumor and microenvironment subspaces using a disentangled multi-modal fusion module, and introduce a confidence-guided gradient coordination strategy to balance subspace optimization. 2) To enhance multi-scale integration, we propose an inter-magnification gene-expression consistency strategy that aligns transcriptomic signals across WSI magnifications. 3) To reduce dependency on paired data, we propose a subspace knowledge distillation strategy enabling transcriptome-agnostic inference through a WSI-only student model. 4) To improve inference efficiency, we propose an informative token aggregation module that suppresses WSI redundancy while preserving subspace semantics. Extensive experiments on cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and survival prediction demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods across multiple settings.

| **[A Multimodal-Multitask Framework with Cross-modal Relation and Hierarchical Interactive Attention for Semantic Comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16300v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal representations, especially when these representations are obtained through explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities. To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities, reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA) to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Information Fusion</p></details> |

The integration of multimodal data sources further enhances its potential. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) is a distributed approach that enhances the efficiency and quality of multimodal learning, ensuring collaborative work and privacy protection. However, missing modalities pose a significant challenge in MFL, often due to data quality issues or privacy policies across the clients. In this work, we present MMiC, a framework for Mitigating Modality incompleteness in MFL within the Clusters. MMiC replaces partial parameters within client models inside clusters to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Furthermore, it leverages the Banzhaf Power Index to optimize client selection under these conditions. Finally, MMiC employs an innovative approach to dynamically control global aggregation by utilizing Markovitz Portfolio Optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMiC consistently outperforms existing federated learning architectures in both global and personalized performance on multimodal datasets with missing modalities, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed solution.

However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval, which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by offering more diverse sources of inspiration.

As these models continue to scale explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack, Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will appear in CCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Learning on Multimodal Analysis of Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14926v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic health record (EHR) systems contain a wealth of multimodal clinical data including structured data like clinical codes and unstructured data such as clinical notes. However, many existing EHR-focused studies has traditionally either concentrated on an individual modality or merged different modalities in a rather rudimentary fashion. This approach often results in the perception of structured and unstructured data as separate entities, neglecting the inherent synergy between them. Specifically, the two important modalities contain clinically relevant, inextricably linked and complementary health information. A more complete picture of a patient's medical history is captured by the joint analysis of the two modalities of data. Despite the great success of multimodal contrastive learning on vision-language, its potential remains under-explored in the realm of multimodal EHR, particularly in terms of its theoretical understanding. To accommodate the statistical analysis of multimodal EHR data, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal feature embedding generative model and design a multimodal contrastive loss to obtain the multimodal EHR feature representation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal learning compared to single-modality learning and connects the solution of the loss function to the singular value decomposition of a pointwise mutual information matrix. This connection paves the way for a privacy-preserving algorithm tailored for multimodal EHR feature representation learning. Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithm performs well under a variety of configurations. We further validate the clinical utility of the proposed algorithm in real-world EHR data.</p></details> | 34 pages |
| **[Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer Using Multimodal Learning on Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06627v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers, and early detection remains a major clinical challenge due to the absence of specific symptoms and reliable biomarkers. In this work, we propose a new multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series, pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new biomarkers. Our code is available at https://github.com/MosbahAouad/EarlyPDAC-MML.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPANER: Shared Prompt Aligner for Multimodal Semantic Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13387v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result, modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture. Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |

In the first stage, we introduce a gaze-guided contrastive learning architecture for disease classification. It integrates visual features, clinical labels, bounding boxes, and radiologist eye-tracking signals and is equipped with a novel multi-term gaze-attention loss combining MSE, KL divergence, correlation, and center-of-mass alignment. Incorporating fixations improves F1 score from 0.597 to 0.631 (+5.70%) and AUC from 0.821 to 0.849 (+3.41%), while also improving precision and recall, highlighting the effectiveness of gaze-informed attention supervision. In the second stage, we present a modular report generation pipeline that extracts confidence-weighted diagnostic keywords, maps them to anatomical regions using a curated dictionary constructed from domain-specific priors, and generates region-aligned sentences via structured prompts. This pipeline improves report quality as measured by clinical keyword recall and ROUGE overlap. Our results demonstrate that integrating gaze data improves both classification performance and the interpretability of generated medical reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeAdQA: LLM-Driven Context-Aware Temporal Grounding for Video Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14784v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Question Answering (VideoQA) requires identifying sparse critical moments in long videos and reasoning about their causal relationships to answer semantically complex questions. While recent advances in multimodal learning have improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two prevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling indiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant content; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses causal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The integrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate accurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and NExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially enhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse-LLaVA: Eliminating Alignment Pre-training Through Text-to-Vision Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12466v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional multimodal learning approaches require expensive alignment pre-training to bridge vision and language modalities, typically projecting visual features into discrete text token spaces. We challenge both fundamental assumptions underlying this paradigm by proposing Inverse-LLaVA, a novel approach that eliminates alignment pre-training entirely while inverting the conventional mapping direction. Rather than projecting visual features to text space, our method maps text embeddings into continuous visual representation space and performs fusion within transformer intermediate layers. Through selective additive components in attention mechanisms, we enable dynamic integration of visual and textual representations without requiring massive image-text alignment datasets. Comprehensive experiments across nine multimodal benchmarks demonstrate nuanced performance trade-offs: Inverse-LLaVA achieves notable improvements on reasoning-intensive and cognitive tasks (MM-VET: +0.2%, VizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, cognitive reasoning: +27.2%), while showing expected decreases in perception tasks requiring memorized visual-text associations (celebrity recognition: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%). These results provide the first empirical evidence that alignment pre-training is not necessary for effective multimodal learning, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. Our work establishes the feasibility of a new paradigm that reduces computational requirements by 45%, challenges conventional wisdom about modality fusion, and opens new research directions for efficient multimodal architectures that preserve modality-specific characteristics. Our project website with code and additional resources is available at https://inverse-llava.github.io.</p></details> | 15pages, 3 figures |

While effective in bi-modal setups, these approaches struggle to generalize across multiple modalities and often lack semantic structure in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we propose MOVER, a novel framework that combines optimal transport-based soft alignment with volume-based geometric regularization to build semantically aligned and structured multimodal representations. By integrating a transport-guided matching mechanism with a geometric volume minimization objective (GAVE), MOVER encourages consistent alignment across all modalities in a modality-agnostic manner. Experiments on text-video-audio retrieval tasks demonstrate that MOVER significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot and finetuned settings. Additional analysis shows improved generalization to unseen modality combinations and stronger structural consistency in the learned embedding space.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at CIKM 2025</p></details> |
| **[MANGO: Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow Approach to Fusion Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10133v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention (MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection, but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present \textsc{FLUID}-Flow-Latent Unified Integration via Token Distillation for Expert Specialization, a principled token-level pipeline that improves cross-modal robustness and scalability. \textsc{FLUID} contributes three core elements: (1) \emph{Q-transforms}, learnable query tokens that distill and retain salient token-level features from modality-specific backbones; (2) a two-stage fusion scheme that enforces cross-modal consistency via contrastive alignment and then performs adaptive, task-aware fusion through a gating mechanism and a \emph{Q-bottleneck} that selectively compresses information for downstream reasoning; and (3) a lightweight, load-balanced Mixture-of-Experts at prediction time that enables efficient specialization to diverse semantic patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textsc{FLUID} attains \(91\%\) accuracy on the GLAMI-1M benchmark, significantly outperforming prior baselines and exhibiting strong resilience to label noise, long-tail class imbalance, and semantic heterogeneity. Targeted ablation studies corroborate both the individual and synergistic benefits of the proposed components, positioning \textsc{FLUID} as a scalable, noise-resilient solution for multimodal product classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Multitask Learning Enhance Model Explainability?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06966v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing provides satellite data in diverse types and formats. The usage of multimodal learning networks exploits this diversity to improve model performance, except that the complexity of such networks comes at the expense of their interpretability. In this study, we explore how modalities can be leveraged through multitask learning to intrinsically explain model behavior. In particular, instead of additional inputs, we use certain modalities as additional targets to be predicted along with the main task. The success of this approach relies on the rich information content of satellite data, which remains as input modalities. We show how this modeling context provides numerous benefits: (1) in case of data scarcity, the additional modalities do not need to be collected for model inference at deployment, (2) the model performance remains comparable to the multimodal baseline performance, and in some cases achieves better scores, (3) prediction errors in the main task can be explained via the model behavior in the auxiliary task(s). We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on three datasets, including segmentation, classification, and regression tasks.

| **[Intrinsic Explainability of Multimodal Learning for Crop Yield Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06939v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning enables various machine learning tasks to benefit from diverse data sources, effectively mimicking the interplay of different factors in real-world applications, particularly in agriculture. While the heterogeneous nature of involved data modalities may necessitate the design of complex architectures, the model interpretability is often overlooked. In this study, we leverage the intrinsic explainability of Transformer-based models to explain multimodal learning networks, focusing on the task of crop yield prediction at the subfield level. The large datasets used cover various crops, regions, and years, and include four different input modalities: multispectral satellite and weather time series, terrain elevation maps and soil properties. Based on the self-attention mechanism, we estimate feature attributions using two methods, namely the Attention Rollout (AR) and Generic Attention (GA), and evaluate their performance against Shapley-based model-agnostic estimations, Shapley Value Sampling (SVS). Additionally, we propose the Weighted Modality Activation (WMA) method to assess modality attributions and compare it with SVS attributions. Our findings indicate that Transformer-based models outperform other architectures, specifically convolutional and recurrent networks, achieving R2 scores that are higher by 0.10 and 0.04 at the subfield and field levels, respectively. AR is shown to provide more robust and reliable temporal attributions, as confirmed through qualitative and quantitative evaluation, compared to GA and SVS values. Information about crop phenology stages was leveraged to interpret the explanation results in the light of established agronomic knowledge. Furthermore, modality attributions revealed varying patterns across the two methods compared.[...]</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements, existing methods heavily depend on massive modality-specific labeled data (e.g., video, audio, and image), or are customized for a single modality. In this study, we present Text as Any-Modality by Consistent Prompt Tuning (TaAM-CPT), a scalable approach for constructing a general representation model toward unlimited modalities using solely text data. TaAM-CPT comprises modality prompt pools, text construction, and modality-aligned text encoders from pre-trained models, which allows for extending new modalities by simply adding prompt pools and modality-aligned text encoders. To harmonize the learning across different modalities, TaAM-CPT designs intra- and inter-modal learning objectives, which can capture category details within modalities while maintaining semantic consistency across different modalities. Benefiting from its scalable architecture and pre-trained models, TaAM-CPT can be seamlessly extended to accommodate unlimited modalities. Remarkably, without any modality-specific labeled data, TaAM-CPT achieves leading results on diverse datasets spanning various modalities, including video classification, image classification, and audio classification.

However, GNNs often struggle to capture global structural characteristics, such as crystal systems, limiting their predictive performance. To overcome this issue, we propose CAST, a cross-attention-based multimodal model that integrates graph representations with textual descriptions of materials, effectively preserving critical structural and compositional information. Unlike previous approaches, such as CrysMMNet and MultiMat, which rely on aggregated material-level embeddings, CAST leverages cross-attention mechanisms to combine fine-grained graph node-level and text token-level features. Additionally, we introduce a masked node prediction pretraining strategy that further enhances the alignment between node and text embeddings. Our experimental results demonstrate that CAST outperforms existing baseline models across four key material properties-formation energy, band gap, bulk modulus, and shear modulus-with average relative MAE improvements ranging from 10.2% to 35.7%. Analysis of attention maps confirms the importance of pretraining in effectively aligning multimodal representations. This study underscores the potential of multimodal learning frameworks for developing more accurate and globally informed predictive models in materials science.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

In this work, we propose Surformer v1, a transformer-based architecture designed for surface classification using structured tactile features and PCA-reduced visual embeddings extracted via ResNet-50. The model integrates modality-specific encoders with cross-modal attention layers, enabling rich interactions between vision and touch. Currently, state-of-the-art deep learning models for vision tasks have achieved remarkable performance. With this in mind, our first set of experiments focused exclusively on tactile-only surface classification. Using feature engineering, we trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, assessing their accuracy and inference time. We then implemented an encoder-only Transformer model tailored for tactile features. This model not only achieved the highest accuracy but also demonstrated significantly faster inference time compared to other evaluated models, highlighting its potential for real-time applications. To extend this investigation, we introduced a multimodal fusion setup by combining vision and tactile inputs. We trained both Surformer v1 (using structured features) and Multimodal CNN (using raw images) to examine the impact of feature-based versus image-based multimodal learning on classification accuracy and computational efficiency. The results showed that Surformer v1 achieved 99.4% accuracy with an inference time of 0.77 ms, while the Multimodal CNN achieved slightly higher accuracy but required significantly more inference time. These findings suggest Surformer v1 offers a compelling balance between accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost for surface material recognition.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing approaches that rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness. Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts (DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer (MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS 2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy, interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing modality scenarios at test time.</p></details> |  |

Parallel to this progress, the demand for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has spurred a growing body of research aimed at interpreting the complex decision-making processes of these models. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between January 2020 and early 2024 that focuses on the explainability of multimodal models. Framed within the broader goals of XAI, we examine the literature across multiple dimensions, including model architecture, modalities involved, explanation algorithms and evaluation methodologies. Our analysis reveals that the majority of studies are concentrated on vision-language and language-only models, with attention-based techniques being the most commonly employed for explanation. However, these methods often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of interactions between modalities, a challenge further compounded by the architectural heterogeneity across domains. Importantly, we find that evaluation methods for XAI in multimodal settings are largely non-systematic, lacking consistency, robustness, and consideration for modality-specific cognitive and contextual factors. Based on these findings, we provide a comprehensive set of recommendations aimed at promoting rigorous, transparent, and standardized evaluation and reporting practices in multimodal XAI research. Our goal is to support future research in more interpretable, accountable, and responsible mulitmodal AI systems, with explainability at their core.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning methods have shown promise in surpassing human-level performance, their effectiveness often depends on the availability of high-quality and diverse deception samples. Existing research predominantly focuses on single-domain scenarios, overlooking the significant performance degradation caused by domain shifts. To address this gap, we present the SVC 2025 Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge, a new benchmark designed to evaluate cross-domain generalization in audio-visual deception detection. Participants are required to develop models that not only perform well within individual domains but also generalize across multiple heterogeneous datasets. By leveraging multimodal data, including audio, video, and text, this challenge encourages the design of models capable of capturing subtle and implicit deceptive cues. Through this benchmark, we aim to foster the development of more adaptable, explainable, and practically deployable deception detection systems, advancing the broader field of multimodal learning.

Unlearnable Examples (UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox: users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image (noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

Existing 3D datasets largely focus on either vision-only part segmentation or vision-language scene segmentation, lacking the fine-grained multimodal segmentation needed for robotic navigation and interaction in real-world environments. To address this gap, we present the 3DCoMPaT Grounded Instructions (3DCoMPaT-GrIn) Dataset, a comprehensive resource that pairs rich point cloud descriptions with corresponding part-level segmentation masks. This dataset encompasses extensive samples designed for both PaPGD and fine-grained single-part grounding tasks. To tackle the inherent challenges of grounding objects and generating grounded descriptions at the part level, we propose Kestrel, a part-aware 3D multimodal large language model that integrates an advanced language model for nuanced language comprehension with multi-level point feature propagation and query refinement mechanism to enhance spatial reasoning at the part level. The extensive experiments demonstrate that Kestrel effectively bridges the gap between part-aware language understanding and 3D segmentation grounding, paving the way for more robust and interpretable 3D object comprehension that meets the demands of real-world robotic applications.

| **[Exploring 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Activity Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D task planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advances in multimodal learning. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v4)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes an automatic segmentation model for building facade walls and windows based on multimodal semantic guidance, called Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF). First, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction mechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the semantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the semantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an end-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the mapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the influence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the automation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF outperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF model can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse datasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and generalization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected to provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision technology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application of multimodal learning in the architectural field.</p></details> |  |

The techniques that have been most effective in bridging the gap between human and machine communications include the Chain-of-Thought prompting, Instruction Tuning, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. The improvements in multimodal learning and few-shot or zero-shot techniques have further empowered LLMs to handle complex jobs with minor input. A significant focus is placed on efficiency, detailing scaling strategies, optimization techniques, and the influential Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which strategically routes inputs to specialized subnetworks to boost predictive accuracy, while optimizing resource allocation. This survey also offers a broader perspective on recent advancements in LLMs, going beyond isolated aspects such as model architecture or ethical concerns. Additionally, it explores the role of LLMs in Agentic AI and their use as Autonomous Decision-Making Systems, and categorizes emerging methods that enhance LLM reasoning, efficiency, and ethical alignment. The survey also identifies underexplored areas such as interpretability, cross-modal integration, and sustainability. While significant advancements have been made in LLMs, challenges such as high computational costs, biases, and ethical risks remain. Overcoming these requires a focus on bias mitigation, transparent decision-making, and explicit ethical guidelines. Future research will generally focus on enhancing the model's ability to handle multiple inputs, thereby making it more intelligent, safe, and reliable.</p></details> |  |
| **[SmartCLIP: Modular Vision-language Alignment with Identification Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22264v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)~\citep{radford2021learning} has emerged as a pivotal model in computer vision and multimodal learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance at aligning visual and textual representations through contrastive learning. However, CLIP struggles with potential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from entangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in datasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the model uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the other hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the retention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning disentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on certain downstream tasks involving short prompts. In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible alignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of granularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only \emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also \emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual concepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \ours, a novel approach that identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations in a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its capability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification theory.

| **[MAGE: Multimodal Alignment and Generation Enhancement via Bridging Visual and Semantic Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21741v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the latest advancements in multimodal learning, effectively addressing the spatial and semantic losses of visual data after encoding remains a critical challenge. This is because the performance of large multimodal models is positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error, significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's "Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries. Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved significantly better performance compared to similar works across various evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. Complete code and appendix are available at: https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[One-stage Modality Distillation for Incomplete Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08204v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning based on multimodal data has attracted increasing interest recently. While a variety of sensory modalities can be collected for training, not all of them are always available in development scenarios, which raises the challenge to infer with incomplete modality. To address this issue, this paper presents a one-stage modality distillation framework that unifies the privileged knowledge transfer and modality information fusion into a single optimization procedure via multi-task learning. Compared with the conventional modality distillation that performs them independently, this helps to capture the valuable representation that can assist the final model inference directly. Specifically, we propose the joint adaptation network for the modality transfer task to preserve the privileged information. This addresses the representation heterogeneity caused by input discrepancy via the joint distribution adaptation. Then, we introduce the cross translation network for the modality fusion task to aggregate the restored and available modality features. It leverages the parameters-sharing strategy to capture the cross-modal cues explicitly. Extensive experiments on RGB-D classification and segmentation tasks demonstrate the proposed multimodal inheritance framework can overcome the problem of incomplete modality input in various scenes and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Everything is a Video: Unifying Modalities through Next-Frame Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10503v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning, which involves integrating information from various modalities such as text, images, audio, and video, is pivotal for numerous complex tasks like visual question answering, cross-modal retrieval, and caption generation. Traditional approaches rely on modality-specific encoders and late fusion techniques, which can hinder scalability and flexibility when adapting to new tasks or modalities. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that extends the concept of task reformulation beyond natural language processing (NLP) to multimodal learning. We propose to reformulate diverse multimodal tasks into a unified next-frame prediction problem, allowing a single model to handle different modalities without modality-specific components. This method treats all inputs and outputs as sequential frames in a video, enabling seamless integration of modalities and effective knowledge transfer across tasks. Our approach is evaluated on a range of tasks, including text-to-text, image-to-text, video-to-video, video-to-text, and audio-to-text, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize across modalities with minimal adaptation. We show that task reformulation can significantly simplify multimodal model design across various tasks, laying the groundwork for more generalized multimodal foundation models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

However, VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose \textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment. We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a 680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAIL-Embedding Technical Report: Omni-modal Embedding Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12709v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal embedding models aim to yield informative unified representations that empower diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite promising developments in the evolution from CLIP-based dual-tower architectures to large vision-language models, prior works still face unavoidable challenges in real-world applications and business scenarios, such as the limited modality support, unstable training mechanisms, and industrial domain gaps. In this work, we introduce SAIL-Embedding, an omni-modal embedding foundation model that addresses these issues through tailored training strategies and architectural design. In the optimization procedure, we propose a multi-stage training scheme to boost the multifaceted effectiveness of representation learning. Specifically, the content-aware progressive training aims to enhance the model's adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and master enriched cross-modal proficiency. The collaboration-aware recommendation enhancement training further adapts multimodal representations for recommendation scenarios by distilling knowledge from sequence-to-item and ID-to-item embeddings while mining user historical interests. Concurrently, we develop the stochastic specialization and dataset-driven pattern matching to strengthen model training flexibility and generalizability. Experimental results show that SAIL-Embedding achieves SOTA performance compared to other methods in different retrieval tasks. In online experiments across various real-world scenarios integrated with our model, we observe a significant increase in Lifetime (LT), which is a crucial indicator for the recommendation experience. For instance, the model delivers the 7-day LT gain of +0.5% in the Douyin-Selected scenario. For the Douyin feed rank model, the match features produced by SAIL-Embedding yield a +0.1% AUC gain.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Towards Fast Coarse-graining and Equation Discovery with Foundation Inference Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12618v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g., the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple, simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Representations through Heterogeneous Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05108v4)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating heterogeneous representations from different architectures has facilitated various vision tasks, e.g., some hybrid networks combine transformers and convolutions. However, complementarity between such heterogeneous architectures has not been well exploited in self-supervised learning. Thus, we propose Heterogeneous Self-Supervised Learning (HSSL), which enforces a base model to learn from an auxiliary head whose architecture is heterogeneous from the base model. In this process, HSSL endows the base model with new characteristics in a representation learning way without structural changes. To comprehensively understand the HSSL, we conduct experiments on various heterogeneous pairs containing a base model and an auxiliary head. We discover that the representation quality of the base model moves up as their architecture discrepancy grows. This observation motivates us to propose a search strategy that quickly determines the most suitable auxiliary head for a specific base model to learn and several simple but effective methods to enlarge the model discrepancy. The HSSL is compatible with various self-supervised methods, achieving superior performances on various downstream tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection.

| **[LayerSync: Self-aligning Intermediate Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12581v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient, plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at https://github.com/vita-epfl/LayerSync.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse Design in Nanophotonics via Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00546v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse design in nanophotonics, the computational discovery of structures achieving targeted electromagnetic (EM) responses, has become a key tool for recent optical advances. Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization methods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces and the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review frames ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of representation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and input-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in the solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates optimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact, latent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient global exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique trade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design discovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization with data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve scalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management, geometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints, and advancements in multiphysics co-designs.</p></details> |  |

SPECTRUM comprises three core components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration. (3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

However, high-dimensional embeddings exacerbate computational complexity and storage requirements, thereby hindering practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel training framework named Sequential Matryoshka Embedding Compression (SMEC). This framework introduces the Sequential Matryoshka Representation Learning(SMRL) method to mitigate gradient variance during training, the Adaptive Dimension Selection (ADS) module to reduce information degradation during dimension pruning, and the Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) module to enhance unsupervised learning between high- and low-dimensional embeddings. Experiments on image, text, and multimodal datasets demonstrate that SMEC achieves significant dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance. For instance, on the BEIR dataset, our approach improves the performance of compressed LLM2Vec embeddings (256 dimensions) by 1.1 points and 2.7 points compared to the Matryoshka-Adaptor and Search-Adaptor models, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2025</p></details> |
| **[Riemannian generative decoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19133v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Riemannian representation learning typically relies on an encoder to estimate densities on chosen manifolds. This involves optimizing numerically brittle objectives, potentially harming model training and quality. To completely circumvent this issue, we introduce the Riemannian generative decoder, a unifying approach for finding manifold-valued latents on any Riemannian manifold. Latents are learned with a Riemannian optimizer while jointly training a decoder network. By discarding the encoder, we vastly simplify the manifold constraint compared to current approaches which often only handle few specific manifolds. We validate our approach on three case studies -- a synthetic branching diffusion process, human migrations inferred from mitochondrial DNA, and cells undergoing a cell division cycle -- each showing that learned representations respect the prescribed geometry and capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structure. Our method requires only a decoder, is compatible with existing architectures, and yields interpretable latent spaces aligned with data geometry.

Extending this paradigm to graphs requires a tokenization scheme that handles non-Euclidean structures and multi-scale dependencies efficiently. Existing approaches to graph tokenization, linearized, continuous, and quantized, remain limited in adaptability and efficiency. In particular, most current quantization-based tokenizers organize hierarchical information in fixed or task-agnostic ways, which may either over-represent or under-utilize structural cues, and lack the ability to dynamically reweight contributions from different levels without retraining the encoder. This work presents a hierarchical quantization framework that introduces a self-weighted mechanism for task-adaptive aggregation across multiple scales. The proposed method maintains a frozen encoder while modulating information flow through a lightweight gating process, enabling parameter-efficient adaptation to diverse downstream tasks. Experiments on benchmark datasets for node classification and link prediction demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines under comparable computational budgets.</p></details> |  |

We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep" analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text, 17 pages appendix (excluding references)</p></details> |

By integrating large language models (LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs, offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and resources are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IMDGA-7289.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

ETSC can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens, and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies confirming component efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE BIBM 2025</p></details> |
| **[SDGraph: Multi-Level Sketch Representation Learning by Sparse-Dense Graph Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12192v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Freehand sketches exhibit unique sparsity and abstraction, necessitating learning pipelines distinct from those designed for images. For sketch learning methods, the central objective is to fully exploit the effective information embedded in sketches. However, there is limited research on what constitutes effective sketch information, which in turn constrains the performance of existing approaches. To tackle this issue, we first proposed the Multi-Level Sketch Representation Scheme to systematically identify the effective information. The scheme organizes sketch representation into three levels: sketch-level, stroke-level, and point-level. This design is based on the granularity of analytical elements, from coarse (sketch-level) to fine (point-level), thereby ensuring more comprehensive coverage of the sketch information. For each level, we conducted theoretical analyses and experimental evaluations to identify and validate the effective information. Building on the above studies, we developed SDGraph, a deep learning architecture designed to exploit the identified effective information across the three levels. SDGraph comprises two complementary modules: a Sparse Graph that treats strokes as nodes for sketch-level and stroke-level representation learning, and a Dense Graph that treats points as nodes for sketch-level and point-level representation learning. Both modules employ graph convolution along with down-sampling and up-sampling operations, enabling them to function as both encoder and decoder. Besides that, an information fusion module bridges the two graphs to further enhance feature extraction. SDGraph supports a wide range of sketch-related downstream tasks, achieving accuracy improvements of 1.15\% and 1.70\% over the state-of-the-art in classification and retrieval, respectively, and 36.58\% improvement in vector sketch generation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRL: Discriminative Representation Learning with Parallel Adapters for Class Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12107v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs), remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA) network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference phases.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Can Representation Gaps Be the Key to Enhancing Robustness in Graph-Text Alignment?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12087v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) integrates structural connectivity with rich textual semantics, enabling applications in diverse domains. Current methods largely rely on contrastive learning to maximize cross-modal similarity, assuming tighter coupling between graph and text representations improves transfer performance. However, our empirical analysis reveals that both natural gap expansion and forced gap reduction result in performance degradation by disrupting pre-trained knowledge structures and impairing generalization. This arises from the geometric incompatibility between encoders, where graph encoders capture topological patterns, while text encoders capture semantic structures. Over-alignment compresses these distinct spaces into shared subspaces, causing structure collapse that diminishes both topological reasoning and semantic understanding. We propose \textbf{LLM4GTA}, a gap-aware alignment framework that preserves representation gaps as geometric necessities for maintaining modality-specific knowledge and improving transfer performance. LLM4GTA includes an adaptive gap preservation module to prevent over-alignment by monitoring similarity evolution and an intra-modal compensation mechanism that boosts discriminative power using auxiliary classifiers in graph space. Extensive experiments show significant improvements over existing methods in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[MEASURE: Multi-scale Minimal Sufficient Representation Learning for Domain Generalization in Sleep Staging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12070v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders. However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS, our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods.

In this work, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a series of versatile and compact embedding models, systematically incentivizing advanced embedding capability in LLMs by superior training techniques and high-quality data. For model architecture, we implement the models on a 0.5B compact size with simple mean-pooling to produce fixed-length embeddings and remove the causal attention mask to enable fully bidirectional representation learning. For training techniques, we propose a progressive multi-stage training pipeline: pre-training on weakly supervised large-scale datasets, fine-tuning with supervised high-quality datasets, and contrastive distillation with fine-grained soft signals, integrated with focal-style reweighting and online hard-negative mixing to emphasize difficult samples and enrich hard negatives, respectively. For training data, we curate over 20 categories for pre-training and 100 categories for fine-tuning and contrastive distillation, to improve both performance and generalization, leveraging task-specific instructions, hard-negative mining, and example-based multi-class labeling to ensure high quality. Combining these techniques, our KaLM-Embedding-V2 series achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark, outperforming models of comparable size and rivaling models 3-26x larger, setting a new standard for versatile and compact embedding models under 1B parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 16 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[MIARec: Mutual-influence-aware Heterogeneous Network Embedding for Scientific Paper Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12054v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid expansion of scientific literature, scholars increasingly demand precise and high-quality paper recommendations. Among various recommendation methodologies, graph-based approaches have garnered attention by effectively exploiting the structural characteristics inherent in scholarly networks. However, these methods often overlook the asymmetric academic influence that is prevalent in scholarly networks when learning graph representations. To address this limitation, this study proposes the Mutual-Influence-Aware Recommendation (MIARec) model, which employs a gravity-based approach to measure the mutual academic influence between scholars and incorporates this influence into the feature aggregation process during message propagation in graph representation learning. Additionally, the model utilizes a multi-channel aggregation method to capture both individual embeddings of distinct single relational sub-networks and their interdependent embeddings, thereby enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneous scholarly network. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that the MIARec model outperforms baseline models across three primary evaluation metrics, indicating its effectiveness in scientific paper recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Fair Graph Neural Networks Via Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00382v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in graph representation learning across various real-world applications. However, they often produce biased predictions caused by sensitive attributes, such as religion or gender, an issue that has been largely overlooked in existing methods. Recently, numerous studies have focused on reducing biases in GNNs. However, these approaches often rely on training with partial data (e.g., using either node features or graph structure alone), which can enhance fairness but frequently compromises model utility due to the limited utilization of available graph information. To address this tradeoff, we propose an effective strategy to balance fairness and utility in knowledge distillation. Specifically, we introduce FairDTD, a novel Fair representation learning framework built on Dual-Teacher Distillation, leveraging a causal graph model to guide and optimize the design of the distillation process. Specifically, FairDTD employs two fairness-oriented teacher models: a feature teacher and a structure teacher, to facilitate dual distillation, with the student model learning fairness knowledge from the teachers while also leveraging full data to mitigate utility loss. To enhance information transfer, we incorporate graph-level distillation to provide an indirect supplement of graph information during training, as well as a node-specific temperature module to improve the comprehensive transfer of fair knowledge. Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairDTD achieves optimal fairness while preserving high model utility, showcasing its effectiveness in fair representation learning for GNNs.</p></details> |  |

While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts are created via two-stage imaging feature-space clustering using contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 20 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.

While Knowledge Components (KCs) provide a foundation for such modeling, automated KC extraction from student code is inherently challenging due to insufficient explainability of discovered KCs and the open-endedness of programming problems with significant structural variability across student solutions and complex interactions among programming concepts. In this work, we propose a novel, explainable framework for automated KC discovery through pattern-based KCs: recurring structural patterns within student code that capture the specific programming patterns and language constructs that students must master. Toward this, we train a Variational Autoencoder to generate important representative patterns from student code guided by an explainable, attention-based code representation model that identifies important correct and incorrect pattern implementations from student code. These patterns are then clustered to form pattern-based KCs. We evaluate our KCs using two well-established methods informed by Cognitive Science: learning curve analysis and Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT). Experimental results demonstrate meaningful learning trajectories and significant improvements in DKT predictive performance over traditional KT methods. This work advances knowledge modeling in CS education by providing an automated, scalable, and explainable framework for identifying granular code patterns and algorithmic constructs, essential for student learning.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets limits the development and benchmarking of machine learning models in this domain. This paper introduces a thorough multi-modal dataset, comprising about a million side-scan sonar (SSS) tiles collected along the coast of Catalonia (Spain), complemented by bathymetric maps and a set of co-registered optical images from targeted surveys using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Approximately \num{36000} of the SSS tiles have been manually annotated with segmentation masks to enable supervised fine-tuning of classification models. All the raw sensor data, together with mosaics, are also released to support further exploration and algorithm development. To address challenges in multi-sensor data fusion for AUVs, we spatially associate optical images with corresponding SSS tiles, facilitating self-supervised, cross-modal representation learning. Accompanying open-source preprocessing and annotation tools are provided to enhance accessibility and encourage research. This resource aims to establish a standardized benchmark for underwater habitat mapping, promoting advancements in autonomous seafloor classification and multi-sensor integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artic...</summary><p>Article under review by IJRR</p></details> |

This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities. Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL), showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding capabilities.

However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network (QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the improvement can reach 33.8\%. The code is available at: https://github.com/Jerry2398/QSGNN.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, despite their superior performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters and inference time.</p></details> |  |

Yet, while self-supervised speech representation learning from raw waveforms has been remarkably successful, these approaches have not achieved similar feats for general-purpose audio representation learning from waveforms. Here, we propose WavJEPA, a waveform-based version of the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture. WavJEPA leverages high-level semantic representation learning to tackle the shortcomings of representation learning at the speech unit or token level. We show that this approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art time-domain audio foundation models across a wide variety of downstream benchmark tasks, while requiring considerably fewer computational resources. Additionally, to overcome the performance drop that time-domain models typically exhibit in noisy and reverberant real-world acoustic environments, we present WavJEPA-Nat. WavJEPA-Nat is a multi-channel extension of the WavJEPA architecture trained on simulated naturalistic scenes. We find that WavJEPA-Nat is highly robust to reverberation and noise. These results highlight the feasibility and computational efficiency of general-purpose audio representation learning from raw waveforms, showcasing the potential for low-latency, robust time-domain audio foundation models for real-world applications.</p></details> | Still under review |

We present a self-supervised framework for learning hierarchical manipulation concepts that encode these invariant patterns through cross-modal sensory correlations and multi-level temporal abstractions without requiring human annotation. Our approach combines a cross-modal correlation network that identifies persistent patterns across sensory modalities with a multi-horizon predictor that organizes representations hierarchically across temporal scales. Manipulation concepts learned through this dual structure enable policies to focus on transferable relational patterns while maintaining awareness of both immediate actions and longer-term goals. Empirical evaluation across simulated benchmarks and real-world deployments demonstrates significant performance improvements with our concept-enhanced policies. Analysis reveals that the learned concepts resemble human-interpretable manipulation primitives despite receiving no semantic supervision. This work advances both the understanding of representation learning for manipulation and provides a practical approach to enhancing robotic performance in complex scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

The current approaches to achieve a shared embedding space rely heavily on paired samples from each modality, which are significantly harder to obtain than unpaired ones. In this work, we demonstrate that shared representations can be learned almost exclusively from unpaired data. Our arguments are grounded in the spectral embeddings of the random walk matrices constructed independently from each unimodal representation. Empirical results in computer vision and natural language processing domains support its potential, revealing the effectiveness of unpaired data in capturing meaningful cross-modal relations, demonstrating high capabilities in retrieval tasks, generation, arithmetics, zero-shot, and cross-domain classification. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate these capabilities almost exclusively from unpaired samples, giving rise to a cross-modal embedding that could be viewed as universal, i.e., independent of the specific modalities of the data.

This is typically achieved by generating two disparate views of each instance by applying stochastic transformations, encouraging the model to learn representations invariant to the common underlying object across these views. While this approach facilitates the acquisition of invariant representations for dataset instances under various handcrafted transformations (e.g., random cropping, colour jittering), an exclusive reliance on such data transformations for achieving invariance may inherently limit the model's generalizability to unseen datasets and diverse downstream tasks. The inherent limitation stems from the fact that the finite set of transformations within the data processing pipeline is unable to encompass the full spectrum of potential data variations. In this study, we provide the technical foundation for leveraging semantic pairs to enhance the generalizability of the model's representation and empirically demonstrate that incorporating semantic pairs mitigates the issue of limited transformation coverage. Specifically, we propose that by exposing the model to semantic pairs (i.e., two instances belonging to the same semantic category), we introduce varied real-world scene contexts, thereby fostering the development of more generalizable object representations. To validate this hypothesis, we constructed and released a novel dataset comprising curated semantic pairs and conducted extensive experimentation to empirically establish that their inclusion enables the model to learn more general representations, ultimately leading to improved performance across diverse downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, their representations arguably remain suboptimal, lacking sensitivity to robotic signals such as control actions and proprioceptive states. To address the issue, we introduce Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss (RS-CL), a simple and effective representation regularization for VLA models, designed to bridge the gap between VLM representations and robotic signals. In particular, RS-CL aligns the representations more closely with the robot's proprioceptive states, by using relative distances between the states as soft supervision. Complementing the original action prediction objective, RS-CL effectively enhances control-relevant representation learning, while being lightweight and fully compatible with standard VLA training pipeline. Our empirical results demonstrate that RS-CL substantially improves the manipulation performance of state-of-the-art VLA models; it pushes the prior art from 30.8% to 41.5% on pick-and-place tasks in RoboCasa-Kitchen, through more accurate positioning during grasping and placing, and boosts success rates from 45.0% to 58.3% on challenging real-robot manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 20 pages, 12 figures |

In multivariate time series analysis, dynamic interactions among data variables over time complicate the interpretation of causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to infer the corresponding causal factors. Third, our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and root cause analysis. Fourth, our model analysis validates hyperparameter sensitivity and the time complexity of CDRL4AD. Last, we conduct a case study to show how our approach assists human experts in diagnosing the root causes of anomalies.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 Figures, |

However, existing approaches typically adopt modality-centric modeling strategies that process ID-based and multimodal embeddings independently, failing to capture fine-grained interactions between content semantics and behavioral signals. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Multimodal Fusion (DMF), which introduces a modality-enriched modeling strategy to enable fine-grained interactions between ID-based collaborative representations and multimodal representations for user interest modeling. Specifically, we construct target-aware features to bridge the semantic gap across different embedding spaces and leverage them as side information to enhance the effectiveness of user interest modeling. Furthermore, we design an inference-optimized attention mechanism that decouples the computation of target-aware features and ID-based embeddings before the attention layer, thereby alleviating the computational bottleneck introduced by incorporating target-aware features. To achieve comprehensive multimodal integration, DMF combines user interest representations learned under the modality-centric and modality-enriched modeling strategies. Offline experiments on public and industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DMF. Moreover, DMF has been deployed on the product recommendation system of the international e-commerce platform Lazada, achieving relative improvements of 5.30% in CTCVR and 7.43% in GMV with negligible computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

We present InstructUE, an instruction-aware user embedding foundation model that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate general and instruction-aware user representations. InstructUE introduces a multi-encoder architecture with a lightweight adapter that efficiently processes heterogeneous data from six different sources while preserving their structural characteristics. Additionally, it proposes a novel contrastive-autoregressive training framework that bridges language and representation spaces through a curated UserQA dataset. The contrastive-autoregressive training framework simultaneously leverages autoregressive learning to capture domain knowledge in language space and contrastive learning to align user-text embeddings in representation space, thereby enhancing the instruction-awareness and noise-robustness of user embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world applications, we demonstrate that InstructUE significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple domains including user prediction, marketing, and recommendation scenarios. Our results show that instruction-aware user modeling can effectively achieve instruction-guided denoising of user information in specific scenarios, paving the way for more generalizable and robust user representation learning.</p></details> |  |

Indeed, prior empirical work has already shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image, protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the class-conditional ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in $23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA.

A key challenge lies in the multifactorial nature of general audio representation-representation quality is jointly influenced by variables such as audio length, embedding dimensionality, model depth, model architecture, data volume, etc., many of which are difficult to isolate or express analytically. In this work, we present a systematic study of scaling laws for general audio representations by utilizing embedding effective rank (RankMe) as a unifying metric that encapsulates the impact of diverse variables on representation quality. RankMe enables a label-free, information-theoretic quantification of audio embeddings, allowing us to examine scaling behaviors across a wide hyper-parameter space, including model size, training data volume, computational budget, architectural configurations, etc. Our empirical findings reveal a consistent power-law relationship between RankMe and representation quality, suggesting that embedding effective rank serves as a reliable proxy for assessing and predicting model performance in audio representation learning. This work not only validates the applicability of classical scaling principles to the general audio domain but also offers a theoretically grounded and empirically robust framework for guiding future model scaling strategies in audio foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods recognize discontinuous entities by connecting entity fragments or internal tokens, which face challenges of error propagation and decoding ambiguity due to the wide variety of span or word combinations. To address these issues, we deeply explore discontinuous entity structures and propose an effective Gap-aware grid tagging model for Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition, named GapDNER. Our GapDNER innovatively applies representation learning on the context gaps between entity fragments to resolve decoding ambiguity and enhance discontinuous NER performance. Specifically, we treat the context gap as an additional type of span and convert span classification into a token-pair grid tagging task. Subsequently, we design two interactive components to comprehensively model token-pair grid features from both intra- and inter-span perspectives. The intra-span regularity extraction module employs the biaffine mechanism along with linear attention to capture the internal regularity of each span, while the inter-span relation enhancement module utilizes criss-cross attention to obtain semantic relations among different spans. At the inference stage of entity decoding, we assign a directed edge to each entity fragment and context gap, then use the BFS algorithm to search for all valid paths from the head to tail of grids with entity tags. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that our GapDNER achieves new state-of-the-art performance on discontinuous NER and exhibits remarkable advantages in recognizing complex entity structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&CO. Beyond VLMs, the proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological alignment into representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |

Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled promising few-shot OOD detection frameworks using only a handful of in-distribution (ID) samples. However, existing prompt learning-based OOD methods rely solely on softmax probabilities, overlooking the rich discriminative potential of the feature embeddings learned by VLMs trained on millions of samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel context optimization (CoOp)-based framework that integrates subspace representation learning with prompt tuning. Our approach improves ID-OOD separability by projecting the ID features into a subspace spanned by prompt vectors, while projecting ID-irrelevant features into an orthogonal null space. To train such OOD detection framework, we design an easy-to-handle end-to-end learning criterion that ensures strong OOD detection performance as well as high ID classification accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets showcase the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

To leverage knowledge from large-scale pretraining, prior work has typically built generalist policies either on top of vision-language understanding models (VLMs) or generative models. However, both semantic understanding from vision-language pretraining and visual dynamics modeling from visual-generation pretraining are crucial for embodied robots. Recent unified models of generation and understanding have demonstrated strong capabilities in both comprehension and generation through large-scale pretraining. We posit that robotic policy learning can likewise benefit from the combined strengths of understanding, planning and continuous future representation learning. Building on this insight, we introduce UniCoD, which acquires the ability to dynamically model high-dimensional visual features through pretraining on over 1M internet-scale instructional manipulation videos. Subsequently, UniCoD is fine-tuned on data collected from the robot embodiment, enabling the learning of mappings from predictive representations to action tokens. Extensive experiments show our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of 9\% and 12\% across simulation environments and real-world out-of-distribution tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, EEG-based BCIs are severely constrained by data scarcity and significant inter-subject variability, which hinder the generalization and applicability of EEG decoding models in practical settings. To address these challenges, we propose FusionGen, a novel EEG data generation framework based on disentangled representation learning and feature fusion. By integrating features across trials through a feature matching fusion module and combining them with a lightweight feature extraction and reconstruction pipeline, FusionGen ensures both data diversity and trainability under limited data constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate that FusionGen significantly outperforms existing augmentation techniques, yielding notable improvements in classification accuracy.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we provide a theoretical perspective by formulating self-supervised representation learning as an approximation to supervised representation learning objectives. Based on this formulation, we derive a loss function closely related to popular contrastive losses such as InfoNCE, offering insight into their underlying principles. Our derivation naturally introduces the concepts of prototype representation bias and a balanced contrastive loss, which help explain and improve the behavior of self-supervised learning algorithms. We further show how components of our theoretical framework correspond to established practices in contrastive learning. Finally, we empirically validate the effect of balancing positive and negative pair interactions. All theoretical proofs are provided in the appendix, and our code is included in the supplementary material.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TMLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Self-Supervised Representation Learning with ID-Content Modality Alignment for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10556v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation (SR) models often capture user preferences based on the historically interacted item IDs, which usually obtain sub-optimal performance when the interaction history is limited. Content-based sequential recommendation has recently emerged as a promising direction that exploits items' textual and visual features to enhance preference learning. However, there are still three key challenges: (i) how to reduce the semantic gap between different content modality representations; (ii) how to jointly model user behavior preferences and content preferences; and (iii) how to design an effective training strategy to align ID representations and content representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model, self-supervised representation learning with ID-Content modality alignment, named SICSRec. Firstly, we propose a LLM-driven sample construction method and develop a supervised fine-tuning approach to align item-level modality representations. Secondly, we design a novel Transformer-based sequential model, where an ID-modality sequence encoder captures user behavior preferences, a content-modality sequence encoder learns user content preferences, and a mix-modality sequence decoder grasps the intrinsic relationship between these two types of preferences. Thirdly, we propose a two-step training strategy with a content-aware contrastive learning task to align modality representations and ID representations, which decouples the training process of content modality dependency and item collaborative dependency. Extensive experiments conducted on four public video streaming datasets demonstrate our SICSRec outperforms the state-of-the-art ID-modality sequential recommenders and content-modality sequential recommenders by 8.04% on NDCG@5 and 6.62% on NDCD@10 on average, respectively.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate our approach on three datasets, comparing it to a state-of-the-art baseline in in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. We found that utilizing various transformer layers improves the robustness of authorship attribution models when tested on out-of-domain data, resulting in new state-of-the-art results. Our analysis gives further insights into how our model's different layers get specialized in representing certain stylistic features that benefit the model when tested out of the domain.</p></details> |  |

Unlike standard GNNs that rely on shallow, fixed-hop aggregation, DRTR leverages both static preprocessing and dynamic resampling to capture deeper structural dependencies. A \emph{Distance Recomputator} prunes semantically weak edges using adaptive attention, while a \emph{Topology Reconstructor} establishes latent connections among distant but relevant nodes. This joint mechanism enables more expressive and robust representation learning across evolving graph structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRTR outperforms baseline GNNs in both accuracy and scalability, especially in complex and noisy graph environments.</p></details> |  |

COSINE exploits foundation models to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal prompts, and a SegDecoder to align these representations, model their interaction, and obtain masks specified by input prompts across different granularities. In this way, COSINE overcomes architectural discrepancies, divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies of previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that COSINE has significant performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation tasks. Our exploratory analyses highlight that the synergistic collaboration between using visual and textual prompts leads to significantly improved generalization over single-modality approaches.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV2025 |
| **[Mesh-Gait: A Unified Framework for Gait Recognition Through Multi-Modal Representation Learning from 2D Silhouettes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10406v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers, and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Representation Learning Approach to Feature Drift Detection in Wireless Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10325v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI is foreseen to be a centerpiece in next generation wireless networks enabling enabling ubiquitous communication as well as new services. However, in real deployment, feature distribution changes may degrade the performance of AI models and lead to undesired behaviors. To counter for undetected model degradation, we propose ALERT; a method that can detect feature distribution changes and trigger model re-training that works well on two wireless network use cases: wireless fingerprinting and link anomaly detection. ALERT includes three components: representation learning, statistical testing and utility assessment. We rely on MLP for designing the representation learning component, on Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Population Stability Index tests for designing the statistical testing and a new function for utility assessment. We show the superiority of the proposed method against ten standard drift detection methods available in the literature on two wireless network use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text2Token: Unsupervised Text Representation Learning with Token Target Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10224v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised text representation learning (TRL) is a fundamental task in natural language processing, which is beneficial for improving search and recommendations with the web's unlabeled texts. A recent empirical study finds that the high-quality representation aligns with the key token of the input text, uncovering the potential connection between representation space and vocabulary space. Inspired by the findings, we revisit the generative tasks and develop an unsupervised generative framework for TRL, Text2Token. The framework is based on the token target prediction task, utilizing carefully constructed target token distribution as supervisory signals. To construct the high-quality target token distribution, we analyze the token-alignment properties with advanced embedders and identify two essential categories of key tokens: (1) the meaningful tokens in the text and (2) semantically derived tokens beyond the text. Based on these insights, we propose two methods -- data-driven and model-derived -- to construct synthetic token targets from data or the LLM backbone. Experiments on the MTEB v2 benchmark demonstrate that Text2Token achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art embedder with unsupervised contrastive learning, LLM2Vec. Our analysis further shows that vocabulary and representation spaces optimize together and toward the optimum solution during training, providing new ideas and insights for future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[PANTHER: Generative Pretraining Beyond Language for Sequential User Behavior Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10102v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown that generative pretraining can distill vast world knowledge into compact token representations. While LLMs encapsulate extensive world knowledge, they remain limited in modeling the behavioral knowledge contained within user interaction histories. User behavior forms a distinct modality, where each action, defined by multi-dimensional attributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a behavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and discriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this gap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable representations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from text. We present PANTHER, a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that unifies user behavior pretraining and downstream adaptation, enabling large-scale sequential user representation learning and real-time inference. PANTHER introduces: (1) Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional transaction attributes into an interpretable vocabulary; (2) Sequence Pattern Recognition Module (SPRM) for modeling periodic transaction motifs; (3) a Unified User-Profile Embedding that fuses static demographics with dynamic transaction histories; and (4) Real-time scalability enabled by offline caching of pretrained embeddings for millisecond-level inference. Fully deployed and operational online at WeChat Pay, PANTHER delivers a 25.6 percent boost in next-transaction prediction HitRate@1 and a 38.6 percent relative improvement in fraud detection recall over baselines. Cross-domain evaluations on public benchmarks show strong generalization, achieving up to 21 percent HitRate@1 gains over transformer baselines, establishing PANTHER as a scalable, high-performance framework for industrial sequential user behavior modeling.</p></details> |  |

Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP) have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative \underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}). Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to baseline methods.

| **[Latent Reasoning via Sentence Embedding Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22202v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive language models (LMs) generate one token at a time, yet human reasoning operates over higher-level abstractions - sentences, propositions, and concepts. This contrast raises a central question- Can LMs likewise learn to reason over structured semantic units rather than raw token sequences? In this work, we investigate whether pretrained LMs can be lifted into such abstract reasoning spaces by building on their learned representations. We present a framework that adapts a pretrained token-level LM to operate in sentence space by autoregressively predicting continuous embeddings of next sentences. We explore two embedding paradigms inspired by classical representation learning: 1) semantic embeddings, learned via autoencoding to preserve surface meaning; and 2) contextual embeddings, trained via next-sentence prediction to encode anticipatory structure. We evaluate both under two inference regimes: Discretized, which decodes each predicted embedding into text before re-encoding; and Continuous, which reasons entirely in embedding space for improved efficiency. Across four domains - mathematics, logic, commonsense, and planning - contextual embeddings under continuous inference show competitive performance with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while reducing inference-time FLOPs on average by half. We also present early signs of scalability and modular adaptation. Finally, to visualize latent trajectories, we introduce SentenceLens, a diagnostic tool that decodes intermediate model states into interpretable sentences. Together, our results indicate that pretrained LMs can effectively transition to abstract, structured reasoning within latent embedding spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Previ...</summary><p>Previously titled "Let's Predict Sentence by Sentence"; Presented @ COLM RAM 2 Workshop (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Translution: Unifying Self-attention and Convolution for Adaptive and Relative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10060v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words) to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively. Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast, convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper, we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named {\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution) achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at https://github.com/hehefan/Translution.</p></details> | technical report |

Recent work (METRA) has effectively argued that moving away from mutual information and instead optimizing a certain Wasserstein distance is important for good performance. In this paper, we argue that the benefits seen in that paper can largely be explained within the existing framework of mutual information skill learning (MISL). Our analysis suggests a new MISL method (contrastive successor features) that retains the excellent performance of METRA with fewer moving parts, and highlights connections between skill learning, contrastive representation learning, and successor features.

Among them, the AlphaEarth Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that integrate both physical form and functional meaning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing continuous-time methods face three key challenges: (1) some methods depend solely on node-specific memory without effectively incorporating information from neighboring nodes, resulting in embedding staleness; (2) most fail to explicitly capture correlations between node neighborhoods, limiting contextual awareness; and (3) many fail to fully capture the structural dynamics of evolving graphs, especially in absence of rich link attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce TAWRMAC-a novel framework that integrates Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, Memory Augmentation, and Neighbor Co-occurrence embedding. TAWRMAC enhances embedding stability through a memory-augmented GNN with fixedtime encoding and improves contextual representation by explicitly capturing neighbor correlations. Additionally, its Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart mechanism distinguishes between nodes exhibiting repetitive interactions and those forming new connections beyond their immediate neighborhood. This approach captures structural dynamics better and supports strong inductive learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAWRMAC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic link prediction and node classification under both transductive and inductive settings across three different negative sampling strategies. By providing stable, generalizable, and context-aware embeddings, TAWRMAC advances the state of the art in continuous-time dynamic graph learning.

The method, called *temporal lifting*, introduces a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto \tau(t)$ that regularizes near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving its conservation laws. In the lifted coordinate, trajectories such as those of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ become globally smooth. From the standpoint of machine-learning dynamics, temporal lifting acts as a continuous-time normalization or time-warping operator that can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow architectures used in AI systems.

By fusing reflectance data from operational instruments (VIIRS, MODIS, Sentinel-3, PACE) with TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), our framework, called SIT-FUSE, generates HAB severity and speciation products without requiring per-instrument labeled datasets. The framework employs self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable classes, validated against in-situ data from the Gulf of Mexico and Southern California (2018-2025). Results show strong agreement with total phytoplankton, Karenia brevis, Alexandrium spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. measurements. This work advances scalable HAB monitoring in label-scarce environments while enabling exploratory analysis via hierarchical embeddings: a critical step toward operationalizing self-supervised learning for global aquatic biogeochemistry.</p></details> |  |

In molecular science, where data collection is expensive and important events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is capable of combining temperature information from different molecular simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.</p></details> |  |
| **[HeSRN: Representation Learning On Heterogeneous Graphs via Slot-Aware Retentive Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09767v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers have recently achieved remarkable progress in graph representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies through self-attention. However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks, achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Shared Prototypes for a Multimodal Pulse Motion Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09764v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling multi-modal time-series data is critical for capturing system-level dynamics, particularly in biosignals where modalities such as ECG, PPG, EDA, and accelerometry provide complementary perspectives on interconnected physiological processes. While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) advances have improved unimodal representation learning, existing multi-modal approaches often rely on CLIP-style contrastive objectives that overfit to easily aligned features and misclassify valid cross-modal relationships as negatives, resulting in fragmented and non-generalizable embeddings. To overcome these limitations, we propose ProtoMM, a novel SSL framework that introduces a shared prototype dictionary to anchor heterogeneous modalities in a common embedding space. By clustering representations around shared prototypes rather than explicit negative sampling, our method captures complementary information across modalities and provides a coherent "common language" for physiological signals. In this work, we focus on developing a Pulse Motion foundation model with ProtoMM and demonstrate that our approach outperforms contrastive-only and prior multimodal SSL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance while offering improved interpretability of learned features.</p></details> |  |
| **[STaTS: Structure-Aware Temporal Sequence Summarization via Statistical Window Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09593v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness, and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+ datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30 archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity, demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware time series modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Orthogonal Representation Learning for Estimating Causal Quantities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04274v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end representation learning has become a powerful tool for estimating causal quantities from high-dimensional observational data, but its efficiency remained unclear. Here, we face a central tension: End-to-end representation learning methods often work well in practice but lack asymptotic optimality in the form of the quasi-oracle efficiency. In contrast, two-stage Neyman-orthogonal learners provide such a theoretical optimality property but do not explicitly benefit from the strengths of representation learning. In this work, we step back and ask two research questions: (1) When do representations strengthen existing Neyman-orthogonal learners? and (2) Can a balancing constraint - commonly proposed technique in the representation learning literature - provide improvements to Neyman-orthogonality? We address these two questions through our theoretical and empirical analysis, where we introduce a unifying framework that connects representation learning with Neyman-orthogonal learners (namely, OR-learners). In particular, we show that, under the low-dimensional manifold hypothesis, the OR-learners can strictly improve the estimation error of the standard Neyman-orthogonal learners. At the same time, we find that the balancing constraint requires an additional inductive bias and cannot generally compensate for the lack of Neyman-orthogonality of the end-to-end approaches. Building on these insights, we offer guidelines for how users can effectively combine representation learning with the classical Neyman-orthogonal learners to achieve both practical performance and theoretical guarantees.</p></details> |  |

Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks: causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning abilities of LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2025 Main)</p></details> |
| **[What Do Temporal Graph Learning Models Learn?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09416v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning on temporal graphs has become a central topic in graph representation learning, with numerous benchmarks indicating the strong performance of state-of-the-art models. However, recent work has raised concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density, temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Receiver Generalization for RF Fingerprint Identification via Feature Disentanglement and Adversarial Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09405v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a critical technique for wireless network security, leveraging intrinsic hardware-level imperfections introduced during device manufacturing to enable precise transmitter identification. While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in extracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by receiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise transmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and receiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel noise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the RFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is particularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver, as replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to cross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing domain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver changes. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of design data, the unbalanced distribution of labels, and the inherent diversity of circuit implementations pose significant challenges to learning robust and transferable circuit representations. To address these limitations, we propose CircuitGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning framework that integrates representation scattering and label rebalancing to enhance transferability across heterogeneous circuit graphs. CircuitGCL employs a self-supervised strategy to learn topology-invariant node embeddings through hyperspherical representation scattering, eliminating dependency on large-scale data. Simultaneously, balanced mean squared error (BMSE) and balanced softmax cross-entropy (BSCE) losses are introduced to mitigate label distribution disparities between circuits, enabling robust and transferable parasitic estimation. Evaluated on parasitic capacitance estimation (edge-level task) and ground capacitance classification (node-level task) across TSMC 28nm AMS designs, CircuitGCL outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with the $R^2$ improvement of $33.64\% \sim 44.20\%$ for edge regression and F1-score gain of $0.9\times \sim 2.1\times$ for node classification.

However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Codecs as Biosignal Tokenizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09095v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neurophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer accessible and minimally invasive means of estimating physiological activity for applications in healthcare, diagnostic screening, and even immersive entertainment. However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery, particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals. Overall, the proposed approach provides a versatile solution for biosignal tokenization that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. The source code and model checkpoints are shared.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables, currently under peer review</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Multilevel Manipulation from Limit Order Book via Cascaded Contrastive Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17086v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trade-based manipulation (TBM) undermines the fairness and stability of financial markets drastically. Spoofing, one of the most covert and deceptive TBM strategies, exhibits complex anomaly patterns across multilevel prices, while often being simplified as a single-level manipulation. These patterns are usually concealed within the rich, hierarchical information of the Limit Order Book (LOB), which is challenging to leverage due to high dimensionality and noise. To address this, we propose a representation learning framework combining a cascaded LOB representation architecture with supervised contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently improves detection performance across diverse models, with Transformer-based architectures achieving state-of-the-art results. In addition, we conduct systematic analyses and ablation studies to investigate multilevel manipulation and the contributions of key components for detection, offering broader insights into representation learning and anomaly detection for complex time series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emotion-Disentangled Embedding Alignment for Noise-Robust and Cross-Corpus Speech Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09072v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectiveness of speech emotion recognition in real-world scenarios is often hindered by noisy environments and variability across datasets. This paper introduces a two-step approach to enhance the robustness and generalization of speech emotion recognition models through improved representation learning. First, our model employs EDRL (Emotion-Disentangled Representation Learning) to extract class-specific discriminative features while preserving shared similarities across emotion categories. Next, MEA (Multiblock Embedding Alignment) refines these representations by projecting them into a joint discriminative latent subspace that maximizes covariance with the original speech input. The learned EDRL-MEA embeddings are subsequently used to train an emotion classifier using clean samples from publicly available datasets, and are evaluated on unseen noisy and cross-corpus speech samples. Improved performance under these challenging conditions demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 13 pages, 1 figure |

| **[Progressive Uncertainty-Guided Evidential U-KAN for Trustworthy Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08949v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthy medical image segmentation aims at deliver accurate and reliable results for clinical decision-making. Most existing methods adopt the evidence deep learning (EDL) paradigm due to its computational efficiency and theoretical robustness. However, the EDL-based methods often neglect leveraging uncertainty maps rich in attention cues to refine ambiguous boundary segmentation. To address this, we propose a progressive evidence uncertainty guided attention (PEUA) mechanism to guide the model to focus on the feature representation learning of hard regions. Unlike conventional approaches, PEUA progressively refines attention using uncertainty maps while employing low-rank learning to denoise attention weights, enhancing feature learning for challenging regions. Concurrently, standard EDL methods suppress evidence of incorrect class indiscriminately via Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization, impairing the uncertainty assessment in ambiguous areas and consequently distorts the corresponding attention guidance. We thus introduce a semantic-preserving evidence learning (SAEL) strategy, integrating a semantic-smooth evidence generator and a fidelity-enhancing regularization term to retain critical semantics. Finally, by embedding PEUA and SAEL with the state-of-the-art U-KAN, we proposes Evidential U-KAN, a novel solution for trustworthy medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets demonstrate superior accuracy and reliability over the competing methods.

However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family (e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP, which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the $\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the embedding space.</p></details> | 23 pages |

In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach to mitigate such a majority-biased tendency while preserving valuable information within datasets. Specifically, the first stage proposes a new representation learning technique from the information theory perspective. This approach is theoretically equivalent to minimizing intra-class distance, yielding an effective and well-separated feature space. The second stage develops a novel sampling strategy that selects mathematically informative instances, able to rectify majority-biased decision boundaries without compromising a model's overall performance. As a result, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance across various long-tailed benchmark datasets, validated via extensive experiments.

| **[From Moments to Models: Graphon Mixture-Aware Mixup and Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03690v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world graph datasets often consist of mixtures of populations, where graphs are generated from multiple distinct underlying distributions. However, modern representation learning approaches, such as graph contrastive learning (GCL) and augmentation methods like Mixup, typically overlook this mixture structure. In this work, we propose a unified framework that explicitly models data as a mixture of underlying probabilistic graph generative models represented by graphons. To characterize these graphons, we leverage graph moments (motif densities) to cluster graphs arising from the same model. This enables us to disentangle the mixture components and identify their distinct generative mechanisms. This model-aware partitioning benefits two key graph learning tasks: 1) It enables a graphon-mixture-aware mixup (GMAM), a data augmentation technique that interpolates in a semantically valid space guided by the estimated graphons, instead of assuming a single graphon per class. 2) For GCL, it enables model-adaptive and principled augmentations. Additionally, by introducing a new model-aware objective, our proposed approach (termed MGCL) improves negative sampling by restricting negatives to graphs from other models. We establish a key theoretical guarantee: a novel, tighter bound showing that graphs sampled from graphons with small cut distance will have similar motif densities with high probability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate strong empirical performance. In unsupervised learning, MGCL achieves state-of-the-art results, obtaining the top average rank across eight datasets. In supervised learning, GMAM consistently outperforms existing strategies, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy in 6 out of 7 datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, an overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary unpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image and audio.

The substantial computational demands required for training conventional CL frameworks pose a set of challenges, particularly in terms of energy consumption, data availability, and memory usage. We conduct an evaluation of four widely used CL frameworks: SimCLR, MoCo, SimSiam, and Barlow Twins. We focus on the practical feasibility of these CL frameworks for edge and fog deployment, and introduce a systematic benchmarking strategy that includes energy profiling and reduced training data conditions. Our findings reveal that SimCLR, contrary to its perceived computational cost, demonstrates the lowest energy consumption across various data regimes. Finally, we also extend our analysis by evaluating lightweight neural architectures when paired with CL frameworks. Our study aims to provide insights into the resource implications of deploying CL in edge/fog environments with limited processing capabilities and opens several research directions for its future optimization.</p></details> |  |

Generic embedding models often struggle to represent telecom-specific semantics, limiting their utility in retrieval and downstream tasks. We present T-VEC (Telecom Vectorization Model), a domain-adapted embedding model fine-tuned from the gte-Qwen2-1.5B-instruct backbone using a triplet loss objective. Fine-tuning was performed on T-Embed, a high-quality, large-scale dataset covering diverse telecom concepts, standards, and operational scenarios. Although T-Embed contains some proprietary material and cannot be fully released, we open source 75% of the dataset to support continued research in domain-specific representation learning. On a custom benchmark comprising 1500 query-passage pairs from IETF RFCs and vendor manuals, T-VEC surpasses MPNet, BGE, Jina and E5, demonstrating superior domain grounding and semantic precision in telecom-specific retrieval. Embedding visualizations further showcase tight clustering of telecom-relevant concepts.

Although humans can solve these tasks with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges. Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First, the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework, called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over 10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku and Maze tasks over the recent advances.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning. Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.</p></details> | Submitted to TPAMI |
| **[Provable Speech Attributes Conversion via Latent Independence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05191v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While signal conversion and disentangled representation learning have shown promise for manipulating data attributes across domains such as audio, image, and multimodal generation, existing approaches, especially for speech style conversion, are largely empirical and lack rigorous theoretical foundations to guarantee reliable and interpretable control. In this work, we propose a general framework for speech attribute conversion, accompanied by theoretical analysis and guarantees under reasonable assumptions. Our framework builds on a non-probabilistic autoencoder architecture with an independence constraint between the predicted latent variable and the target controllable variable. This design ensures a consistent signal transformation, conditioned on an observed style variable, while preserving the original content and modifying the desired attribute. We further demonstrate the versatility of our method by evaluating it on speech styles, including speaker identity and emotion. Quantitative evaluations confirm the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI) between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures. Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442 substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112), and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) Predictive Intelligence in Medicine Workshop (MICCAI PRIME) 2025; 13 pages</p></details> |
| **[Learning General Causal Structures with Hidden Dynamic Process for Climate Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12500v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding climate dynamics requires going beyond correlations in observational data to uncover their underlying causal process. Latent drivers, such as atmospheric processes, play a critical role in temporal dynamics, while direct causal influences also exist among geographically proximate observed variables. Traditional Causal Representation Learning (CRL) typically focuses on latent factors but overlooks such observable-to-observable causal relations, limiting its applicability to climate analysis. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework that jointly uncovers (i) causal relations among observed variables and (ii) latent driving forces together with their interactions. We establish conditions under which both the hidden dynamic processes and the causal structure among observed variables are simultaneously identifiable from time-series data. Remarkably, our guarantees hold even in the nonparametric setting, leveraging contextual information to recover latent variables and causal relations. Building on these insights, we propose CaDRe (Causal Discovery and Representation learning), a time-series generative model with structural constraints that integrates CRL and causal discovery. Experiments on synthetic datasets validate our theoretical results. On real-world climate datasets, CaDRe not only delivers competitive forecasting accuracy but also recovers visualized causal graphs aligned with domain expertise, thereby offering interpretable insights into climate systems.</p></details> |  |

A key component for such systems is the automated evaluation via machine learning models. In this paper, we address critical challenges in this domain and demonstrate how representations learned via self-supervised learning can effectively identify toxicant-induced changes. We provide a proof-of-concept that utilizes the publicly available EmbryoNet dataset, which contains ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic development. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between the modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration of machine learning models in a physical toxicity testing device in the context of the TOXBOX project.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches assume homogeneous client models and largely overlook the challenge of model-centric heterogeneous FGL (MHtFGL), which frequently arises in practice when organizations employ graph neural networks (GNNs) of different scales and architectures.Such architectural diversity not only undermines smooth server-side aggregation, which presupposes a unified representation space shared across clients' updates, but also further complicates the transfer and integration of structural knowledge across clients. To address this issue, we propose the Federated Graph Knowledge Collaboration (FedGKC) framework. FedGKC introduces a lightweight Copilot Model on each client to facilitate knowledge exchange while local architectures are heterogeneous across clients, and employs two complementary mechanisms: Client-side Self-Mutual Knowledge Distillation, which transfers effective knowledge between local and copilot models through bidirectional distillation with multi-view perturbation; and Server-side Knowledge-Aware Model Aggregation, which dynamically assigns aggregation weights based on knowledge provided by clients. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedGKC achieves an average accuracy gain of 3.74% over baselines in MHtFGL scenarios, while maintaining excellent performance in homogeneous settings.</p></details> |  |

Our method first clusters $X$ and $Y$ independently, then learns a sparse, interpretable bridge between clusters using only a few paired examples. At inference, a new input $x$ is assigned to its nearest input cluster, and the centroid of the linked output cluster is returned as the prediction $\hat{y}$. Unlike traditional SSL, Bridged Clustering explicitly leverages output-only data, and unlike dense transport-based methods, it maintains a sparse and interpretable alignment. Through theoretical analysis, we show that with bounded mis-clustering and mis-bridging rates, our algorithm becomes an effective and efficient predictor. Empirically, our method is competitive with SOTA methods while remaining simple, model-agnostic, and highly label-efficient in low-supervision settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality Guided Representation Learning for Cross-Style Hate Speech Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07707v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony, stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations. Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches. Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders, thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues. Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in advancing generalizable hate speech detection.</p></details> |  |

For example, goal-conditioned reinforcement learning can be viewed as learning representations to predict which states are likely to be visited in the future. While prior methods have used contrastive predictive coding to model time series data, learning representations that encode long-term dependencies usually requires large amounts of data. In this paper, we introduce a temporal difference version of contrastive predictive coding that stitches together pieces of different time series data to decrease the amount of data required to learn predictions of future events. We apply this representation learning method to derive an off-policy algorithm for goal-conditioned RL. Experiments demonstrate that, compared with prior RL methods, ours achieves $2 \times$ median improvement in success rates and can better cope with stochastic environments. In tabular settings, we show that our method is about $20 \times$ more sample efficient than the successor representation and $1500 \times$ more sample efficient than the standard (Monte Carlo) version of contrastive predictive coding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024.

While pre-trained 2D graph encoders have demonstrated strong performance, they overlook the rich molecular domain knowledge associated with submolecular instances (atoms and bonds). While molecular pre-training approaches incorporate such knowledge into their pre-training objectives, they typically employ designs tailored to a specific type of knowledge, lacking the flexibility to integrate diverse knowledge present in molecules. Hence, reusing widely available and well-validated pre-trained 2D encoders, while incorporating molecular domain knowledge during downstream adaptation, offers a more practical alternative. In this work, we propose MolGA, which adapts pre-trained 2D graph encoders to downstream molecular applications by flexibly incorporating diverse molecular domain knowledge. First, we propose a molecular alignment strategy that bridge the gap between pre-trained topological representations with domain-knowledge representations. Second, we introduce a conditional adaptation mechanism that generates instance-specific tokens to enable fine-grained integration of molecular domain knowledge for downstream tasks. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on eleven public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of MolGA.</p></details> | Under review |

Meta's DINOv3 extends earlier SSL models through Gram-anchored self-distillation. Whether these design choices improve transfer learning for chest radiography has not been systematically tested. We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across seven datasets (n>814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated: ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and 1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The primary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2 achieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to 512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and ImageNet. In contrast, results in pediatric cohort showed no differences across initializations. Across all settings, ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16. Models using frozen DINOv3-7B features underperformed relative to fully finetuned 86-89M-parameter backbones, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation. Scaling to 1024x1024 did not further improve accuracy. Resolution-related gains were most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities. In chest radiography, higher input resolution is critical for leveraging the benefits of modern self-supervised models. 512x512 pixels represent a practical upper limit where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide the strongest performance, while larger inputs offer minimal return on cost. Clinically, these findings support use of finetuned, mid-sized backbones at 512x512 for chest radiograph interpretation, with the greatest gains expected in detecting subtle or boundary-centered lesions relevant to emergency and critical care settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[GNN-enhanced Traffic Anomaly Detection for Next-Generation SDN-Enabled Consumer Electronics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07109v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consumer electronics (CE) connected to the Internet of Things are susceptible to various attacks, including DDoS and web-based threats, which can compromise their functionality and facilitate remote hijacking. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to exploit CE for broader system attacks while enabling the propagation of malicious code across the CE network, resulting in device failures. Existing deep learning-based traffic anomaly detection systems exhibit high accuracy in traditional network environments but are often overly complex and reliant on static infrastructure, necessitating manual configuration and management. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable network model that integrates Software-defined Networking (SDN) and Compute First Networking (CFN) for next-generation CE networks. In this network model, we propose a Graph Neural Networks-based Network Anomaly Detection framework (GNN-NAD) that integrates SDN-based CE networks and enables the CFN architecture. GNN-NAD uniquely fuses a static, vulnerability-aware attack graph with dynamic traffic features, providing a holistic view of network security. The core of the framework is a GNN model (GSAGE) for graph representation learning, followed by a Random Forest (RF) classifier. This design (GSAGE+RF) demonstrates superior performance compared to existing feature selection methods. Experimental evaluations on CE environment reveal that GNN-NAD achieves superior metrics in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score, even with small sample sizes, exceeding the performance of current network anomaly detection methods. This work advances the security and efficiency of next-generation intelligent CE networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics. 10 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Unified Molecule Pre-training with Flexible 2D and 3D Modalities: Single and Paired Modality Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07035v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in advancing applications such as drug discovery and material design. Existing work leverages 2D and 3D modalities of molecular information for pre-training, aiming to capture comprehensive structural and geometric insights. However, these methods require paired 2D and 3D molecular data to train the model effectively and prevent it from collapsing into a single modality, posing limitations in scenarios where a certain modality is unavailable or computationally expensive to generate. To overcome this limitation, we propose FlexMol, a flexible molecule pre-training framework that learns unified molecular representations while supporting single-modality input. Specifically, inspired by the unified structure in vision-language models, our approach employs separate models for 2D and 3D molecular data, leverages parameter sharing to improve computational efficiency, and utilizes a decoder to generate features for the missing modality. This enables a multistage continuous learning process where both modalities contribute collaboratively during training, while ensuring robustness when only one modality is available during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexMol achieves superior performance across a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks, and we also empirically demonstrate its effectiveness with incomplete data. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/tewiSong/FlexMol.</p></details> | CIKM 2025 |
| **[Relational Database Distillation: From Structured Tables to Condensed Graph Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06980v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational databases (RDBs) underpin the majority of global data management systems, where information is structured into multiple interdependent tables. To effectively use the knowledge within RDBs for predictive tasks, recent advances leverage graph representation learning to capture complex inter-table relations as multi-hop dependencies. Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance, these methods remain hindered by the prohibitive storage overhead and excessive training time, due to the massive scale of the database and the computational burden of intensive message passing across interconnected tables. To alleviate these concerns, we propose and study the problem of Relational Database Distillation (RDD). Specifically, we aim to distill large-scale RDBs into compact heterogeneous graphs while retaining the predictive power (i.e., utility) required for training graph-based models. Multi-modal column information is preserved through node features, and primary-foreign key relations are encoded via heterogeneous edges, thereby maintaining both data fidelity and relational structure. To ensure adaptability across diverse downstream tasks without engaging the traditional, inefficient bi-level distillation framework, we further design a kernel ridge regression-guided objective with pseudo-labels, which produces quality features for the distilled graph. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world RDBs demonstrate that our solution substantially reduces the data size while maintaining competitive performance on classification and regression tasks, creating an effective pathway for scalable learning with RDBs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Global Representation from Queries for Vectorized HD Map Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06969v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The online construction of vectorized high-definition (HD) maps is a cornerstone of modern autonomous driving systems. State-of-the-art approaches, particularly those based on the DETR framework, formulate this as an instance detection problem. However, their reliance on independent, learnable object queries results in a predominantly local query perspective, neglecting the inherent global representation within HD maps. In this work, we propose \textbf{MapGR} (\textbf{G}lobal \textbf{R}epresentation learning for HD \textbf{Map} construction), an architecture designed to learn and utilize a global representations from queries. Our method introduces two synergistic modules: a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module, which encourages the distribution of all queries to better align with the global map through a carefully designed holistic segmentation task, and a Global Representation Guidance (GRG) module, which endows each individual query with explicit, global-level contextual information to facilitate its optimization. Evaluations on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to leading baselines.</p></details> | 16 pages |

However, existing deep constrained clustering (DCC) methods are either limited by anchors inherent in end-to-end modeling or struggle with learning discriminative Euclidean embedding, restricting their scalability and real-world applicability. To avoid their respective pitfalls, we propose a novel angular constraint embedding approach for DCC, termed SpherePair. Using the SpherePair loss with a geometric formulation, our method faithfully encodes pairwise constraints and leads to embeddings that are clustering-friendly in angular space, effectively separating representation learning from clustering. SpherePair preserves pairwise relations without conflict, removes the need to specify the exact number of clusters, generalizes to unseen data, enables rapid inference of the number of clusters, and is supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art DCC methods on diverse benchmarks, along with empirical validation of theoretical insights, confirm its superior performance, scalability, and overall real-world effectiveness.

A major challenge lies in the non-stationary nature of quality distributions in real-world scenarios, which limits the generalization ability of conventional methods. We introduce Continual AQA (CAQA), which equips AQA with Continual Learning (CL) capabilities to handle evolving distributions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Although parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pretrained models has shown promise in CL for image classification, we find it insufficient for CAQA. Our empirical and theoretical analyses reveal two insights: (i) Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FPFT) is necessary for effective representation learning; yet (ii) uncontrolled FPFT induces overfitting and feature manifold shift, thereby aggravating forgetting. To address this, we propose Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization (MAGR++), which couples backbone fine-tuning that stabilizes shallow layers while adapting deeper ones with a two-step feature rectification pipeline: a manifold projector to translate deviated historical features into the current representation space, and a graph regularizer to align local and global distributions. We construct four CAQA benchmarks from three datasets with tailored evaluation protocols and strong baselines, enabling systematic cross-dataset comparison. Extensive experiments show that MAGR++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average correlation gains of 3.6% offline and 12.2% online over the strongest baseline, confirming its robustness and effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhouKanglei/MAGRPP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended Version of MAGR (ECCV 2024 Oral Presentation)</p></details> |

Most existing approaches lack transparency in their decision-making and provide limited attribution to credible sources. We introduce FinVet, a novel multi-agent framework that integrates two Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with external fact-checking through a confidence-weighted voting mechanism. FinVet employs adaptive three-tier processing that dynamically adjusts verification strategies based on retrieval confidence, from direct metadata extraction to hybrid reasoning to full model-based analysis. Unlike existing methods, FinVet provides evidence-backed verdicts, source attribution, confidence scores, and explicit uncertainty flags when evidence is insufficient. Experimental evaluation on the FinFact dataset shows that FinVet achieves an F1 score of 0.85, which is a 10.4% improvement over the best individual pipeline (fact-check pipeline) and 37% improvement over standalone RAG approaches.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing the sentiment expressed in these online discussions can offer valuable insights into public perception, inform policy decisions, and enhance emergency responses. Although sentiment analysis has been widely studied in various fields, its specific application to climate-induced events, particularly in real-time, high-impact situations like the 2025 Los Angeles forest fires, remains underexplored. In this survey, we thoroughly examine the methods, datasets, challenges, and ethical considerations related to sentiment analysis of social media content concerning weather and climate change events. We present a detailed taxonomy of approaches, ranging from lexicon-based and machine learning models to the latest strategies driven by large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we discuss data collection and annotation techniques, including weak supervision and real-time event tracking. Finally, we highlight several open problems, such as misinformation detection, multimodal sentiment extraction, and model alignment with human values. Our goal is to guide researchers and practitioners in effectively understanding sentiment during the climate crisis era.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and Published in SBP-BRiMS 2025. 18th International Conference on Social Computing, Behavioral-Cultural Modeling & Prediction and Behavior Representation in Modeling and Simulation</p></details> |

Existing efforts in misinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant gap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We introduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three languages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the transcripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy, fact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to facilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in cross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization to unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the complexity of claim detection in video transcripts. ViClaim offers a robust foundation for advancing misinformation detection in video-based communication, addressing a critical gap in multimodal analysis.</p></details> |  |

While prior work has explored various adversarial attacks in misinformation detection, the specific transformations examined in this paper have not been systematically studied. In particular, we investigate language-switching across English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, and Chinese, followed by translation. We also study query length inflation preceding summarization and structural reformatting into multiple-choice questions. In this paper, we present a multilingual, multi-agent large language model framework with retrieval-augmented generation that can be deployed as a web plugin into online platforms. Our work underscores the importance of AI-driven misinformation detection in safeguarding online factual integrity against diverse attacks, while showcasing the feasibility of plugin-based deployment for real-world web applications.</p></details> |  |

Existing AI-driven detection systems often require domain-specific finetuning, limiting generalizability, and offer little insight into their decisions, hindering trust and adoption. We introduce MAD-Sherlock, a multi-agent debate system for out-of-context misinformation detection. MAD-Sherlock frames detection as a multi-agent debate, reflecting the diverse and conflicting discourse found online. Multimodal agents collaborate to assess contextual consistency and retrieve external information to support cross-context reasoning. Our framework is domain- and time-agnostic, requiring no finetuning, yet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with in-depth explanations. Evaluated on NewsCLIPpings, VERITE, and MMFakeBench, it outperforms prior methods by 2%, 3%, and 5%, respectively. Ablation and user studies show that the debate and resultant explanations significantly improve detection performance and improve trust for both experts and non-experts, positioning MAD-Sherlock as a robust tool for autonomous citizen intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[CrediBench: Building Web-Scale Network Datasets for Information Integrity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23340v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online misinformation poses an escalating threat, amplified by the Internet's open nature and increasingly capable LLMs that generate persuasive yet deceptive content. Existing misinformation detection methods typically focus on either textual content or network structure in isolation, failing to leverage the rich, dynamic interplay between website content and hyperlink relationships that characterizes real-world misinformation ecosystems. We introduce CrediBench: a large-scale data processing pipeline for constructing temporal web graphs that jointly model textual content and hyperlink structure for misinformation detection. Unlike prior work, our approach captures the dynamic evolution of general misinformation domains, including changes in both content and inter-site references over time. Our processed one-month snapshot extracted from the Common Crawl archive in December 2024 contains 45 million nodes and 1 billion edges, representing the largest web graph dataset made publicly available for misinformation research to date. From our experiments on this graph snapshot, we demonstrate the strength of both structural and webpage content signals for learning credibility scores, which measure source reliability. The pipeline and experimentation code are all available here, and the dataset is in this folder.</p></details> | 16 pages,4 figures |
| **[Dialogues with AI Reduce Beliefs in Misinformation but Build No Lasting Discernment Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01537v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the growing prevalence of fake information, including increasingly realistic AI-generated news, there is an urgent need to train people to better evaluate and detect misinformation. While interactions with AI have been shown to durably reduce people's beliefs in false information, it is unclear whether these interactions also teach people the skills to discern false information themselves. We conducted a month-long study where 67 participants classified news headline-image pairs as real or fake, discussed their assessments with an AI system, followed by an unassisted evaluation of unseen news items to measure accuracy before, during, and after AI assistance. While AI assistance produced immediate improvements during AI-assisted sessions (+21\% average), participants' unassisted performance on new items declined significantly by week 4 (-15.3\%). These results indicate that while AI may help immediately, it ultimately degrades long-term misinformation detection abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[o-MEGA: Optimized Methods for Explanation Generation and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00288v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of transformer-based language models has revolutionized NLP domain while simultaneously introduced significant challenges regarding model transparency and trustworthiness. The complexity of achieving explainable systems in this domain is evidenced by the extensive array of explanation methods and evaluation metrics developed by researchers. To address the challenge of selecting optimal explainability approaches, we present \textbf{\texttt{o-mega}}, a hyperparameter optimization tool designed to automatically identify the most effective explainable AI methods and their configurations within the semantic matching domain. We evaluate o-mega on a post-claim matching pipeline using a curated dataset of social media posts paired with refuting claims. Our tool systematically explores different explainable methods and their hyperparameters, demonstrating improved transparency in automated fact-checking systems. As a result, such automated optimization of explanation methods can significantly enhance the interpretability of claim-matching models in critical applications such as misinformation detection, contributing to more trustworthy and transparent AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Interpreting such creator intent is therefore essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) and effective information governance. To this end, we introduce DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark of 12,000 image-caption pairs grounded in trustworthy reference articles, created using an intent-guided simulation framework that models both the desired influence and the execution plan of news creators. The dataset captures both misleading and non-misleading cases, spanning manipulations across visual and textual modalities, and supports three intent-centric tasks: (1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3) creator desire inference. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) and find that they struggle with intent reasoning, often relying on shallow cues such as surface-level alignment, stylistic polish, or heuristic authenticity signals. These results highlight the limitations of current VLMs and position DeceptionDecoded as a foundation for developing intent-aware models that go beyond shallow cues in MMD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unified Multimodal Misinformation Detection in Social Media: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25991v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios, however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world multimodal deception detection.</p></details> |  |

We present ShortCheck, a modular, inference-only pipeline with a user-friendly interface that automatically identifies checkworthy short-form videos to help human fact-checkers. The system integrates speech transcription, OCR, object and deepfake detection, video-to-text summarization, and claim verification. ShortCheck is validated by evaluating it on two manually annotated datasets with TikTok videos in a multilingual setting. The pipeline achieves promising results with F1-weighted score over 70\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Agent Framework with Automated Decision Rule Optimization for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23329v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spans various domains, but detection methods trained on specific domains often perform poorly when applied to others. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have begun to utilize LLMs for cross-domain misinformation detection. However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to adequately analyze news in the target domain, limiting their detection capabilities. More importantly, these methods typically rely on manually designed decision rules, which are limited by domain knowledge and expert experience, thus limiting the generalizability of decision rules to different domains. To address these issues, we propose a MultiAgent Framework for cross-domain misinformation detection with Automated Decision Rule Optimization (MARO). Under this framework, we first employs multiple expert agents to analyze target-domain news. Subsequently, we introduce a question-reflection mechanism that guides expert agents to facilitate higherquality analysis. Furthermore, we propose a decision rule optimization approach based on carefully-designed cross-domain validation tasks to iteratively enhance the effectiveness of decision rules in different domains. Experimental results and in-depth analysis on commonlyused datasets demonstrate that MARO achieves significant improvements over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, current misinformation detection approaches implicitly assume that misinformation is static. We introduce MPCG, a multi-round, persona-conditioned framework that simulates how claims are iteratively reinterpreted by agents with distinct ideological perspectives. Our approach uses an uncensored large language model (LLM) to generate persona-specific claims across multiple rounds, conditioning each generation on outputs from the previous round, enabling the study of misinformation evolution. We evaluate the generated claims through human and LLM-based annotations, cognitive effort metrics (readability, perplexity), emotion evocation metrics (sentiment analysis, morality), clustering, feasibility, and downstream classification. Results show strong agreement between human and GPT-4o-mini annotations, with higher divergence in fluency judgments. Generated claims require greater cognitive effort than the original claims and consistently reflect persona-aligned emotional and moral framing. Clustering and cosine similarity analyses confirm semantic drift across rounds while preserving topical coherence. Feasibility results show a 77% feasibility rate, confirming suitability for downstream tasks. Classification results reveal that commonly used misinformation detectors experience macro-F1 performance drops of up to 49.7%.

While automated fact-checking has emerged as a viable solution, most current systems are limited to evaluating factual accuracy. However, the detrimental effect of misinformation transcends simple falsehoods; it takes advantage of how individuals perceive, interpret, and emotionally react to information. This underscores the need to move beyond factuality and adopt more human-centered detection frameworks. In this survey, we explore the evolving interplay between traditional fact-checking approaches and psychological concepts such as cognitive biases, social dynamics, and emotional responses. By analyzing state-of-the-art misinformation detection systems through the lens of human psychology and behavior, we reveal critical limitations of current methods and identify opportunities for improvement. Additionally, we outline future research directions aimed at creating more robust and adaptive frameworks, such as neuro-behavioural models that integrate technological factors with the complexities of human cognition and social influence. These approaches offer promising pathways to more effectively detect and mitigate the societal harms of misinformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EMNLP'25 Main</p></details> |

Misinformation changes rapidly, much more quickly than moderators can annotate at scale, resulting in a shift between the training and inference data distributions. As a result, misinformation detectors need to be able to perform out-of-distribution generalization, an attribute they currently lack. Our benchmark uses distant labelling to enable simulating covariate shifts in misinformation content. We identify time, event, topic, publisher, political bias, misinformation type as important axes for generalization, and we evaluate a common class of baseline models on each. Using article metadata, we show how this model fails desiderata, which is not necessarily obvious from classification metrics. Finally, we analyze properties of the data to ensure limited presence of modelling shortcuts.

Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also offering strong generalization and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025; Project Homepage: https://yanzehong.github.io/trust-vl/</p></details> |

Our work is motivated by the limitations of current Explainable AI (XAI) approaches, which predominantly focus on content explanations that elucidate the linguistic features and sentence structures of the misinformation. To address this limitation, we explore various explanations beyond content explanation, such as "social explanation" that considers the broader social context surrounding misinformation, as well as a "combined explanation" where both the content and social explanations are presented in scenarios that are either aligned or misaligned with each other. To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of these AI explanations, we conduct two online crowdsourcing experiments in the COVID-19 (Study 1 on Prolific) and Politics domains (Study 2 on MTurk). Our results show that AI explanations are generally effective in aiding users to detect misinformation, with effectiveness significantly influenced by the alignment between content and social explanations. We also find that the order in which explanation types are presented - specifically, whether a content or social explanation comes first - can influence detection accuracy, with differences found between the COVID-19 and Political domains. This work contributes towards more effective design of AI explanations, fostering a deeper understanding of how different explanation types and their combinations influence misinformation detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at CSCW 2025</p></details> |

We investigate the challenge of generating adversarial examples to test the robustness of text classification algorithms detecting low-credibility content, including propaganda, false claims, rumours and hyperpartisan news. We focus on simulation of content moderation by setting realistic limits on the number of queries an attacker is allowed to attempt. Within our solution (TREPAT), initial rephrasings are generated by large language models with prompts inspired by meaning-preserving NLP tasks, such as text simplification and style transfer. Subsequently, these modifications are decomposed into small changes, applied through beam search procedure, until the victim classifier changes its decision. We perform (1) quantitative evaluation using various prompts, models and query limits, (2) targeted manual assessment of the generated text and (3) qualitative linguistic analysis. The results confirm the superiority of our approach in the constrained scenario, especially in case of long input text (news articles), where exhaustive search is not feasible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Despite significant advancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains (source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains (target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain generalization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose deep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection on various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly focusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial to achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For some domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis relying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in each modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this fusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of misinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization model via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation detection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We involve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a shared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal learning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core features of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through cross-modal guided denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DOCTOR model.

Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that enhance automated reasoning, their application to misinformation detection remains hindered by issues of logical inconsistency and superficial verification. In response, we introduce Debate-to-Detect (D2D), a novel Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework that reformulates misinformation detection as a structured adversarial debate. Inspired by fact-checking workflows, D2D assigns domain-specific profiles to each agent and orchestrates a five-stage debate process, including Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing Statement, and Judgment. To transcend traditional binary classification, D2D introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism that assesses each claim across five distinct dimensions: Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o on two datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the case study highlight D2D's capability to iteratively refine evidence while improving decision transparency, representing a substantial advancement towards interpretable misinformation detection. The code will be released publicly after the official publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |

Existing approaches often struggle with capturing long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph. By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies, even with limited labelled datasets while improving generalizability.</p></details> |  |

While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have enabled recent progress in multimodal misinformation detection (MMD), the rise of generative AI (GenAI) tools introduces a new challenge: GenAI-driven news diversity, characterized by highly varied and complex content. We show that this diversity induces multi-level drift, comprising (1) model-level misperception drift, where stylistic variations disrupt a model's internal reasoning, and (2) evidence-level drift, where expression diversity degrades the quality or relevance of retrieved external evidence. These drifts significantly degrade the robustness of current LVLM-based MMD systems. To systematically study this problem, we introduce DriftBench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 16,000 news instances across six categories of diversification. We design three evaluation tasks: (1) robustness of truth verification under multi-level drift; (2) susceptibility to adversarial evidence contamination generated by GenAI; and (3) analysis of reasoning consistency across diverse inputs. Experiments with six state-of-the-art LVLM-based detectors show substantial performance drops (average F1 -14.8%) and increasingly unstable reasoning traces, with even more severe failures under adversarial evidence injection. Our findings uncover fundamental vulnerabilities in existing MMD systems and suggest an urgent need for more resilient approaches in the GenAI era.</p></details> |  |
| **[E-CaTCH: Event-Centric Cross-Modal Attention with Temporal Consistency and Class-Imbalance Handling for Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11197v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting multimodal misinformation on social media remains challenging due to inconsistencies between modalities, changes in temporal patterns, and substantial class imbalance. Many existing methods treat posts independently and fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time and modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for robustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into pseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then processes each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual features are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via intra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal attention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form contextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal evolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a trend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode narrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event level, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To address class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates adaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example mining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments on Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrate its robustness, generalizability, and practical applicability across diverse misinformation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, its effectiveness is fundamentally limited by three core challenges: (i) insufficient diversity in generated rationales, (ii) factual inaccuracies due to hallucinations, and (iii) irrelevant or conflicting content that introduces noise. We introduce DiFaR, a detector-agnostic framework that produces diverse, factual, and relevant rationales to enhance misinformation detection. DiFaR employs five chain-of-thought prompts to elicit varied reasoning traces from LVLMs and incorporates a lightweight post-hoc filtering module to select rationale sentences based on sentence-level factuality and relevance scores. Extensive experiments on four popular benchmarks demonstrate that DiFaR outperforms four baseline categories by up to 5.9% and boosts existing detectors by as much as 8.7%. Both automatic metrics and human evaluations confirm that DiFaR significantly improves rationale quality across all three dimensions.</p></details> |  |

Accordingly, automatically distinguishing misinformation, dubbed as Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an increasingly active research topic. The mainstream methods formulate MD as a static learning paradigm, which learns the mapping between the content, links, and propagation of news articles and the corresponding manual veracity labels. However, the static assumption is often violated, since in real-world scenarios, the veracity of news articles may vacillate within the dynamically evolving social environment. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework, namely Misinformation detection with Dynamic Environmental Representations (MISDER). The basic idea of MISDER lies in learning a social environmental representation for each period and employing a temporal model to predict the representation for future periods. In this work, we specify the temporal model as the LSTM model, continuous dynamics equation, and pre-trained dynamics system, suggesting three variants of MISDER, namely MISDER-LSTM, MISDER-ODE, and MISDER-PT, respectively. To evaluate the performance of MISDER, we compare it to various MD baselines across 2 prevalent datasets, and the experimental results can indicate the effectiveness of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025. 11 pages, 4 figures.

This research proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics, quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency, and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory Network for Multi-modal Manipulation Detecting and Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02479v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$) is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision, we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FMS compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events, or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new content to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable insights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation detection.

To address this, we have curated the largest collection of (mis)information datasets in the literature, totaling 75. From these, we evaluated the quality of 36 datasets that consist of statements or claims, as well as the 9 datasets that consist of data in purely paragraph form. We assess these datasets to identify those with solid foundations for empirical work and those with flaws that could result in misleading and non-generalizable results, such as spurious correlations, or examples that are ambiguous or otherwise impossible to assess for veracity. We find the latter issue is particularly severe and affects most datasets in the literature. We further provide state-of-the-art baselines on all these datasets, but show that regardless of label quality, categorical labels may no longer give an accurate evaluation of detection model performance. Finally, we propose and highlight Evaluation Quality Assurance (EQA) as a tool to guide the field toward systemic solutions rather than inadvertently propagating issues in evaluation. Overall, this guide aims to provide a roadmap for higher quality data and better grounded evaluations, ultimately improving research in misinformation detection.

To support fact-checkers, researchers have focused on developing datasets and methods for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD). Due to the scarcity of large-scale annotated MMD datasets, recent approaches rely on synthetic training data created via out-of-context pairings or named entity manipulations (e.g., altering names, dates, or locations). However, these often yield simplistic examples that lack real-world complexity, limiting model robustness. Meanwhile, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain underexplored for generating diverse and realistic synthetic data for MMD. To address, we introduce "Miscaption This!", a collection of LVLM-generated miscaptioned image datasets. Additionally, we introduce "Latent Multimodal Reconstruction" (LAMAR), a network trained to reconstruct the embeddings of truthful captions, providing a strong auxiliary signal to guide detection. We explore various training strategies (end-to-end vs. large-scale pre-training) and integration mechanisms (direct, mask, gate, and attention). Extensive experiments show that models trained on "MisCaption This!" generalize better to real-world misinformation while LAMAR achieves new state-of-the-art on both NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks; highlighting the value of LVLM-generated data and reconstruction-based networks for advancing MMD.

Lacking robust automated tools, Hindi faces challenges in scaling misinformation detection. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework integrating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with curriculum learning to align machine-generated explanations with human reasoning. Fact-checked explanations from credible sources serve as preferred responses, while LLM outputs highlight system limitations and serve as non-preferred responses. To refine task-specific alignment, we introduce two key parameters -- Actuality and Finesse -- into the DPO loss function, enhancing explanation quality and consistency. Experiments with LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and PLMs (mBART, mT5) confirm the framework's effectiveness in generating coherent, contextually relevant explanations. This scalable approach combats misinformation and extends automated explanation generation to low-resource languages.</p></details> |  |

We introduce RAMA, a novel retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed for verifying multimedia misinformation.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAMA achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in resolving ambiguous or improbable claims by grounding verification in retrieved factual evidence. Our findings underscore the necessity of integrating web-based evidence and multi-agent reasoning for trustworthy multimedia verification, paving the way for more reliable and scalable fact-checking solutions.

To control their propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active topic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD methods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in real-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models trained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this issue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative, inducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by two major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the detection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second, the social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the generalization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to remember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific parameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and anticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time dynamics model. Accordingly, we induce a new continual MMD method DAEDCMD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAEDCMD can consistently and significantly outperform the compared methods, including six MMD baselines and three continual learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025. 10 pages, 6 figures.

Such content often includes localized image edits and cross-lingual inconsistencies that jointly distort meaning while remaining superficially plausible. We introduce BiMi, a bilingual multimodal framework that jointly performs region-level localization, cross-modal and cross-lingual consistency detection, and natural language explanation for misinformation analysis. To support generalization, BiMi integrates an online retrieval module that supplements model reasoning with up-to-date external context. We further release BiMiBench, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark constructed by systematically editing real news images and subtitles, comprising 104,000 samples with realistic manipulations across visual and linguistic modalities. To enhance interpretability, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve explanation quality, marking the first use of GRPO in this domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiMi outperforms strong baselines by up to +8.9 in classification accuracy, +15.9 in localization accuracy, and +2.5 in explanation BERTScore, advancing state-of-the-art performance in realistic, multilingual misinformation detection.

In this paper, we introduce Misinfo-TeleGraph, the first German-language Telegram-based graph dataset for misinformation detection. It includes over 5 million messages from public channels, enriched with metadata, channel relationships, and both weak and strong labels. These labels are derived via semantic similarity to fact-checks and news articles using M3-embeddings, as well as manual annotation. To establish reproducible baselines, we evaluate both text-only models and graph neural networks (GNNs) that incorporate message forwarding as a network structure. Our results show that GraphSAGE with LSTM aggregation significantly outperforms text-only baselines in terms of Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and F1-score. We further evaluate the impact of subscribers, view counts, and automatically versus human-created labels on performance, and highlight both the potential and challenges of weak supervision in this domain.

However, only a few studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR). The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models and by 5% compared to bimodal models.

| **[GraphRAG-Causal: A novel graph-augmented framework for causal reasoning and annotation in news](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11600v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GraphRAG-Causal introduces an innovative framework that combines graph-based retrieval with large language models to enhance causal reasoning in news analysis. Traditional NLP approaches often struggle with identifying complex, implicit causal links, especially in low-data scenarios. Our approach addresses these challenges by transforming annotated news headlines into structured causal knowledge graphs. It then employs a hybrid retrieval system that merges semantic embeddings with graph-based structural cues leveraging Neo4j to accurately match and retrieve relevant events. The framework is built on a three-stage pipeline: First, during Data Preparation, news sentences are meticulously annotated and converted into causal graphs capturing cause, effect, and trigger relationships. Next, the Graph Retrieval stage stores these graphs along with their embeddings in a Neo4j database and utilizes hybrid Cypher queries to efficiently identify events that share both semantic and structural similarities with a given query. Finally, the LLM Inference stage utilizes these retrieved causal graphs in a few-shot learning setup with XML-based prompting, enabling robust classification and tagging of causal relationships. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GraphRAG-Causal achieves an impressive F1-score of 82.1% on causal classification using just 20 few-shot examples. This approach significantly boosts accuracy and consistency, making it highly suitable for real-time applications in news reliability assessment, misinformation detection, and policy analysis.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |
| **[A Survey of Datasets for Information Diffusion Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05161v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information diffusion across various new media platforms gradually influences perceptions, decisions, and social behaviors of individual users. In communication studies, the famous Five W's of Communication model (5W Model) has displayed the process of information diffusion clearly. At present, although plenty of studies and corresponding datasets about information diffusion have emerged, a systematic categorization of tasks and an integration of datasets are still lacking. To address this gap, we survey a systematic taxonomy of information diffusion tasks and datasets based on the "5W Model" framework. We first categorize the information diffusion tasks into ten subtasks with definitions and datasets analysis, from three main tasks of information diffusion prediction, social bot detection, and misinformation detection. We also collect the publicly available dataset repository of information diffusion tasks with the available links and compare them based on six attributes affiliated to users and content: user information, social network, bot label, propagation content, propagation network, and veracity label. In addition, we discuss the limitations and future directions of current datasets and research topics to advance the future development of information diffusion. The dataset repository can be accessed at our website https://github.com/fuxiaG/Information-Diffusion-Datasets.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.</p></details> | 34 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Truth over Tricks: Measuring and Mitigating Shortcut Learning in Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02350v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation detection models often rely on superficial cues (i.e., \emph{shortcuts}) that correlate with misinformation in training data but fail to generalize to the diverse and evolving nature of real-world misinformation. This issue is exacerbated by large language models (LLMs), which can easily generate convincing misinformation through simple prompts. We introduce TruthOverTricks, a unified evaluation paradigm for measuring shortcut learning in misinformation detection. TruthOverTricks categorizes shortcut behaviors into intrinsic shortcut induction and extrinsic shortcut injection, and evaluates seven representative detectors across 14 popular benchmarks, along with two new factual misinformation datasets, NQ-Misinfo and Streaming-Misinfo. Empirical results reveal that existing detectors suffer severe performance degradation when exposed to both naturally occurring and adversarially crafted shortcuts. To address this, we propose SMF, an LLM-augmented data augmentation framework that mitigates shortcut reliance through paraphrasing, factual summarization, and sentiment normalization. SMF consistently enhances robustness across 16 benchmarks, encouraging models to rely on deeper semantic understanding rather than shortcut cues. To promote the development of misinformation detectors, we have published the resources publicly at https://github.com/whr000001/TruthOverTricks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Large Language Models for Misinformation Detection in Low-Resource Linguistic Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01587v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of social media platforms has significantly increased the dissemination of forged content and misinformation, making the detection of fake news a critical area of research. Although fact-checking efforts predominantly focus on English-language news, there is a noticeable gap in resources and strategies to detect news in regional languages, such as Urdu. Advanced Fake News Detection (FND) techniques rely heavily on large, accurately labeled datasets. However, FND in under-resourced languages like Urdu faces substantial challenges due to the scarcity of extensive corpora and the lack of validated lexical resources. Current Urdu fake news datasets are often domain-specific and inaccessible to the public. They also lack human verification, relying mainly on unverified English-to-Urdu translations, which compromises their reliability in practical applications. This study highlights the necessity of developing reliable, expert-verified, and domain-independent Urdu-enhanced FND datasets to improve fake news detection in Urdu and other resource-constrained languages. This paper presents the first benchmark large FND dataset for Urdu news, which is publicly available for validation and deep analysis. We also evaluate this dataset using multiple state-of-the-art pre-trained large language models (LLMs), such as XLNet, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa. Additionally, we propose a unified LLM model that outperforms the others with different embedding and feature extraction techniques. The performance of these models is compared based on accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and human judgment for vetting the sample results of news.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAEmoLLM: Retrieval Augmented LLMs for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection Using In-Context Learning Based on Emotional Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11093v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation is prevalent in various fields such as education, politics, health, etc., causing significant harm to society. However, current methods for cross-domain misinformation detection rely on effort- and resource-intensive fine-tuning and complex model structures. With the outstanding performance of LLMs, many studies have employed them for misinformation detection. Unfortunately, they focus on in-domain tasks and do not incorporate significant sentiment and emotion features (which we jointly call {\em affect}). In this paper, we propose RAEmoLLM, the first retrieval augmented (RAG) LLMs framework to address cross-domain misinformation detection using in-context learning based on affective information. RAEmoLLM includes three modules. (1) In the index construction module, we apply an emotional LLM to obtain affective embeddings from all domains to construct a retrieval database. (2) The retrieval module uses the database to recommend top K examples (text-label pairs) from source domain data for target domain contents. (3) These examples are adopted as few-shot demonstrations for the inference module to process the target domain content. The RAEmoLLM can effectively enhance the general performance of LLMs in cross-domain misinformation detection tasks through affect-based retrieval, without fine-tuning. We evaluate our framework on three misinformation benchmarks. Results show that RAEmoLLM achieves significant improvements compared to the other few-shot methods on three datasets, with the highest increases of 15.64%, 31.18%, and 15.73% respectively. This project is available at https://github.com/lzw108/RAEmoLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> |
| **[CMIE: Combining MLLM Insights with External Evidence for Explainable Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23449v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in visual reasoning and text generation. While previous studies have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG) strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Community Moderation and the New Epistemology of Fact Checking on Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20067v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media platforms have traditionally relied on internal moderation teams and partnerships with independent fact-checking organizations to identify and flag misleading content. Recently, however, platforms including X (formerly Twitter) and Meta have shifted towards community-driven content moderation by launching their own versions of crowd-sourced fact-checking -- Community Notes. If effectively scaled and governed, such crowd-checking initiatives have the potential to combat misinformation with increased scale and speed as successfully as community-driven efforts once did with spam. Nevertheless, general content moderation, especially for misinformation, is inherently more complex. Public perceptions of truth are often shaped by personal biases, political leanings, and cultural contexts, complicating consensus on what constitutes misleading content. This suggests that community efforts, while valuable, cannot replace the indispensable role of professional fact-checkers. Here we systemically examine the current approaches to misinformation detection across major platforms, explore the emerging role of community-driven moderation, and critically evaluate both the promises and challenges of crowd-checking at scale.</p></details> | 1 Figure, 2 tables |
| **[T^2Agent A Tool-augmented Multimodal Misinformation Detection Agent with Monte Carlo Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19768v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world multimodal misinformation often arises from mixed forgery sources, requiring dynamic reasoning and adaptive verification. However, existing methods mainly rely on static pipelines and limited tool usage, limiting their ability to handle such complexity and diversity. To address this challenge, we propose T2Agent, a novel misinformation detection agent that incorporates an extensible toolkit with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The toolkit consists of modular tools such as web search, forgery detection, and consistency analysis. Each tool is described using standardized templates, enabling seamless integration and future expansion. To avoid inefficiency from using all tools simultaneously, a Bayesian optimization-based selector is proposed to identify a task-relevant subset. This subset then serves as the action space for MCTS to dynamically collect evidence and perform multi-source verification. To better align MCTS with the multi-source nature of misinformation detection, T2Agent extends traditional MCTS with multi-source verification, which decomposes the task into coordinated subtasks targeting different forgery sources. A dual reward mechanism containing a reasoning trajectory score and a confidence score is further proposed to encourage a balance between exploration across mixed forgery sources and exploitation for more reliable evidence. We conduct ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of the tree search mechanism and tool usage. Extensive experiments further show that T2Agent consistently outperforms existing baselines on challenging mixed-source multimodal misinformation benchmarks, demonstrating its strong potential as a training-free approach for enhancing detection accuracy. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Generation to Detection: A Multimodal Multi-Task Dataset for Benchmarking Health Misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18685v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infodemics and health misinformation have significant negative impact on individuals and society, exacerbating confusion and increasing hesitancy in adopting recommended health measures. Recent advancements in generative AI, capable of producing realistic, human like text and images, have significantly accelerated the spread and expanded the reach of health misinformation, resulting in an alarming surge in its dissemination. To combat the infodemics, most existing work has focused on developing misinformation datasets from social media and fact checking platforms, but has faced limitations in topical coverage, inclusion of AI generation, and accessibility of raw content. To address these issues, we present MM Health, a large scale multimodal misinformation dataset in the health domain consisting of 34,746 news article encompassing both textual and visual information. MM Health includes human-generated multimodal information (5,776 articles) and AI generated multimodal information (28,880 articles) from various SOTA generative AI models. Additionally, We benchmarked our dataset against three tasks (reliability checks, originality checks, and fine-grained AI detection) demonstrating that existing SOTA models struggle to accurately distinguish the reliability and origin of information. Our dataset aims to support the development of misinformation detection across various health scenarios, facilitating the detection of human and machine generated content at multimodal levels.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Evidence-Grounded Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Attention-Based GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18221v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation is misinformation that repurposes real images with unrelated or misleading captions. Detecting such misinformation is challenging because it requires resolving the context of the claim before checking for misinformation. Many current methods, including LLMs and LVLMs, do not perform this contextualization step. LLMs hallucinate in absence of context or parametric knowledge. In this work, we propose a graph-based method that evaluates the consistency between the image and the caption by constructing two graph representations: an evidence graph, derived from online textual evidence, and a claim graph, from the claim in the caption. Using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode and compare these representations, our framework then evaluates the truthfulness of image-caption pairs. We create datasets for our graph-based method, evaluate and compare our baseline model against popular LLMs on the misinformation detection task. Our method scores $93.05\%$ detection accuracy on the evaluation set and outperforms the second-best performing method (an LLM) by $2.82\%$, making a case for smaller and task-specific methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Systems for Misinformation Lifecycle : Detection, Correction And Source Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17511v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of misinformation in digital media demands solutions that go beyond isolated Large Language Model(LLM) or AI Agent based detection methods. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent framework that covers the complete misinformation lifecycle: classification, detection, correction, and source verification to deliver more transparent and reliable outcomes. In contrast to single-agent or monolithic architectures, our approach employs five specialized agents: an Indexer agent for dynamically maintaining trusted repositories, a Classifier agent for labeling misinformation types, an Extractor agent for evidence based retrieval and ranking, a Corrector agent for generating fact-based correction and a Verification agent for validating outputs and tracking source credibility. Each agent can be individually evaluated and optimized, ensuring scalability and adaptability as new types of misinformation and data sources emerge. By decomposing the misinformation lifecycle into specialized agents - our framework enhances scalability, modularity, and explainability. This paper proposes a high-level system overview, agent design with emphasis on transparency, evidence-based outputs, and source provenance to support robust misinformation detection and correction at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Fake News Belief via Skin and Blood Flow Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16730v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation poses significant risks to public opinion, health, and security. While most fake news detection methods rely on text analysis, little is known about how people physically respond to false information or repeated exposure to the same statements. This study investigates whether wearable sensors can detect belief in a statement or prior exposure to it. We conducted a controlled experiment where participants evaluated statements while wearing an EmotiBit sensor that measured their skin conductance (electrodermal activity, EDA) and peripheral blood flow (photoplethysmography, PPG). From 28 participants, we collected a dataset of 672 trials, each labeled with whether the participant believed the statement and whether they had seen it before. This dataset introduces a new resource for studying physiological responses to misinformation. Using machine learning models, including KNN, CNN, and LightGBM, we analyzed these physiological patterns. The best-performing model achieved 67.83\% accuracy, with skin conductance outperforming PPG. These findings demonstrate the potential of wearable sensors as a minimally intrusive tool for detecting belief and prior exposure, offering new directions for real-time misinformation detection and adaptive, user-aware systems.</p></details> | Research Report |
| **[Truth and Trust: Fake News Detection via Biosignals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16702v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how individuals physiologically respond to false information is crucial for advancing misinformation detection systems. This study explores the potential of using physiological signals, specifically electrodermal activity (EDA) and photoplethysmography (PPG), to classify both the veracity of information and its interaction with user belief. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we collected EDA and PPG signals while participants evaluated the truthfulness of climate-related claims. Each trial was labeled based on the objective truth of the claim and the participant's belief, enabling two classification tasks: binary veracity detection and a novel four-class joint belief-veracity classification. We extracted handcrafted features from the raw signals and trained several machine learning models to benchmark the dataset. Our results show that EDA outperforms PPG, indicating its greater sensitivity to physiological responses related to truth perception. However, performance significantly drops in the joint belief-veracity classification task, highlighting the complexity of modeling the interaction between belief and truth. These findings suggest that while physiological signals can reflect basic truth perception, accurately modeling the intricate relationships between belief and veracity remains a significant challenge. This study emphasizes the importance of multimodal approaches that incorporate psychological, physiological, and cognitive factors to improve fake news detection systems. Our work provides a foundation for future research aimed at enhancing misinformation detection via addressing the complexities of human belief and truth processing.</p></details> | Research report |

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized stance detection by introducing novel capabilities in contextual understanding, cross-domain generalization, and multimodal analysis. Despite these progressions, existing surveys often lack comprehensive coverage of approaches that specifically leverage LLMs for stance detection. To bridge this critical gap, our review article conducts a systematic analysis of stance detection, comprehensively examining recent advancements of LLMs transforming the field, including foundational concepts, methodologies, datasets, applications, and emerging challenges. We present a novel taxonomy for LLM-based stance detection approaches, structured along three key dimensions: 1) learning methods, including supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, and zero-shot; 2) data modalities, such as unimodal, multimodal, and hybrid; and 3) target relationships, encompassing in-target, cross-target, and multi-target scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation techniques and analyze benchmark datasets and performance trends, highlighting the strengths and limitations of different architectures. Key applications in misinformation detection, political analysis, public health monitoring, and social media moderation are discussed. Finally, we identify critical challenges such as implicit stance expression, cultural biases, and computational constraints, while outlining promising future directions, including explainable stance reasoning, low-resource adaptation, and real-time deployment frameworks. Our survey highlights emerging trends, open challenges, and future directions to guide researchers and practitioners in developing next-generation stance detection systems powered by large language models.</p></details> |  |

However, existing profiling techniques, including tweet summarization, attribute-based profiling, and latent representation learning, face significant limitations: they often lack transferability, produce non-interpretable features, require large labeled datasets, or rely on rigid predefined categories that limit adaptability. We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-based approach that leverages domain-defining statements, which serve as key characteristics outlining the important pillars of a domain as foundations for profiling. Our two-stage method first employs semi-supervised filtering with a domain-specific knowledge base, then generates both abstractive (synthesized descriptions) and extractive (representative tweet selections) user profiles. By harnessing LLMs' inherent knowledge with minimal human validation, our approach is adaptable across domains while reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Our method generates interpretable natural language user profiles, condensing extensive user data into a scale that unlocks LLMs' reasoning and knowledge capabilities for downstream social network tasks. We contribute a Persian political Twitter (X) dataset and an LLM-based evaluation framework with human validation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and traditional methods by 9.8%, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating flexible, adaptable, and interpretable user profiles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MisD @ AAAI ICWSM 2025</p></details> |

Existing black-box text-based adversarial attacks are ill-suited for evidence-based misinformation detection systems, as these attacks primarily focus on token-level substitutions involving gradient or logit-based optimization strategies, which are incapable of fooling the multi-component nature of these detection systems. These systems incorporate both retrieval and claim-evidence comparison modules, which requires attacks to break the retrieval of evidence and/or the comparison module so that it draws incorrect inferences. We present CAMOUFLAGE, an iterative, LLM-driven approach that employs a two-agent system, a Prompt Optimization Agent and an Attacker Agent, to create adversarial claim rewritings that manipulate evidence retrieval and mislead claim-evidence comparison, effectively bypassing the system without altering the meaning of the claim. The Attacker Agent produces semantically equivalent rewrites that attempt to mislead detectors, while the Prompt Optimization Agent analyzes failed attack attempts and refines the prompt of the Attacker to guide subsequent rewrites. This enables larger structural and stylistic transformations of the text rather than token-level substitutions, adapting the magnitude of changes based on previous outcomes. Unlike existing approaches, CAMOUFLAGE optimizes its attack solely based on binary model decisions to guide its rewriting process, eliminating the need for classifier logits or extensive querying. We evaluate CAMOUFLAGE on four systems, including two recent academic systems and two real-world APIs, with an average attack success rate of 46.92\% while preserving textual coherence and semantic equivalence to the original claims.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate this challenge, Misinformation Detection (MD), aiming to detect online misinformation automatically, emerges as a rapidly growing research topic in the community. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play augmentation method for the MD task, namely Misinformation Detection with Potential Commonsense Conflict (MD-PCC). We take inspiration from the prior studies indicating that fake articles are more likely to involve commonsense conflict. Accordingly, we construct commonsense expressions for articles, serving to express potential commonsense conflicts inferred by the difference between extracted commonsense triplet and golden ones inferred by the well-established commonsense reasoning tool COMET. These expressions are then specified for each article as augmentation. Any specific MD methods can be then trained on those commonsense-augmented articles. Besides, we also collect a novel commonsense-oriented dataset named CoMis, whose all fake articles are caused by commonsense conflict. We integrate MD-PCC with various existing MD backbones and compare them across both 4 public benchmark datasets and CoMis. Empirical results demonstrate that MD-PCC can consistently outperform the existing MD baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures. Accepted by IJCAI 2025.

Traditional misinformation detection methods primarily focus on surface-level features, overlooking the crucial roles of human empathy in the propagation process. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Aspect Empathy Framework (DAE), which integrates cognitive and emotional empathy to analyze misinformation from both the creator and reader perspectives. By examining creators' cognitive strategies and emotional appeals, as well as simulating readers' cognitive judgments and emotional responses using Large Language Models (LLMs), DAE offers a more comprehensive and human-centric approach to misinformation detection. Moreover, we further introduce an empathy-aware filtering mechanism to enhance response authenticity and diversity. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAE outperforms existing methods, providing a novel paradigm for multimodal misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |

As an initial step toward this vision, we present Factually - a proactive, wearable fact-checking system integrated into devices like smartwatches or rings. Factually discreetly alerts users to potential falsehoods via vibrotactile feedback, helping them assess information critically.

Most approaches to misinformation detection are monolingual, focused on high-resource languages, i.e., a handful of world languages that have benefited from substantial research investment. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current research on misinformation detection in low-resource languages, both in monolingual and multilingual settings. We review existing datasets, methodologies, and tools used in these domains, identifying key challenges related to: data resources, model development, cultural and linguistic context, and real-world applications. We examine emerging approaches, such as language-generalizable models and multi-modal techniques, and emphasize the need for improved data collection practices, interdisciplinary collaboration, and stronger incentives for socially responsible AI research. Our findings underscore the importance of systems capable of addressing misinformation across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.</p></details> |  |

A dataset of 5,614 posts on the internet that contained misinformation about COVID-19 was used for this study. These posts were published in 2020 on 427 online sources (such as social media platforms, news channels, and online blogs) from 193 countries and in 49 languages. First, this paper presents a structured, three-tier analytical framework that investigates how multiple motives - including fear, politics, and profit - can lead to a misleading claim. Second, it emphasizes the importance of narrative structures, systematically identifying and quantifying the thematic elements that drive conspiracy theories, fake remedies, and false reports. Third, it presents a comprehensive analysis of different sources of misinformation, highlighting the varied roles played by individuals, state-based organizations, media outlets, and other sources. Finally, it discusses multiple potential implications of these findings for public policy and health communication, illustrating how insights gained from motive, narrative, and source analyses can guide more targeted interventions in the context of misinformation detection on digital platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Explainable Framework for Misinformation Identification via Critical Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14626v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language misinformation detection approaches have been, to date, largely dependent on sequence classification methods, producing opaque systems in which the reasons behind classification as misinformation are unclear. While an effort has been made in the area of automated fact-checking to propose explainable approaches to the problem, this is not the case for automated reason-checking systems. In this paper, we propose a new explainable framework for both factual and rational misinformation detection based on the theory of Argumentation Schemes and Critical Questions. For that purpose, we create and release NLAS-CQ, the first corpus combining 3,566 textbook-like natural language argumentation scheme instances and 4,687 corresponding answers to critical questions related to these arguments. On the basis of this corpus, we implement and validate our new framework which combines classification with question answering to analyse arguments in search of misinformation, and provides the explanations in form of critical questions to the human user.</p></details> |  |

| **[Limited Effectiveness of LLM-based Data Augmentation for COVID-19 Misinformation Stance Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02328v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation surrounding emerging outbreaks poses a serious societal threat, making robust countermeasures essential. One promising approach is stance detection (SD), which identifies whether social media posts support or oppose misleading claims. In this work, we finetune classifiers on COVID-19 misinformation SD datasets consisting of claims and corresponding tweets. Specifically, we test controllable misinformation generation (CMG) using large language models (LLMs) as a method for data augmentation. While CMG demonstrates the potential for expanding training datasets, our experiments reveal that performance gains over traditional augmentation methods are often minimal and inconsistent, primarily due to built-in safeguards within LLMs. We release our code and datasets to facilitate further research on misinformation detection and generation.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA2 have been envisioned as possible tools for detecting misinformation based on their advanced natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. This paper conducts a comparison of LLM-based approaches to detecting misinformation between text-based, multimodal, and agentic approaches. We evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuned models, zero-shot learning, and systematic fact-checking mechanisms in detecting misinformation across different topic domains like public health, politics, and finance. We also discuss scalability, generalizability, and explainability of the models and recognize key challenges such as hallucination, adversarial attacks on misinformation, and computational resources. Our findings point towards the importance of hybrid approaches that pair structured verification protocols with adaptive learning techniques to enhance detection accuracy and explainability. The paper closes by suggesting potential avenues of future work, including real-time tracking of misinformation, federated learning, and cross-platform detection models.</p></details> |  |
| **[EXCLAIM: An Explainable Cross-Modal Agentic System for Misinformation Detection with Hierarchical Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06269v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation continues to pose a significant challenge in today's information ecosystem, profoundly shaping public perception and behavior. Among its various manifestations, Out-of-Context (OOC) misinformation is particularly obscure, as it distorts meaning by pairing authentic images with misleading textual narratives. Existing methods for detecting OOC misinformation predominantly rely on coarse-grained similarity metrics between image-text pairs, which often fail to capture subtle inconsistencies or provide meaningful explainability. While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in visual reasoning and explanation generation, they have not yet demonstrated the capacity to address complex, fine-grained, and cross-modal distinctions necessary for robust OOC detection. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EXCLAIM, a retrieval-based framework designed to leverage external knowledge through multi-granularity index of multi-modal events and entities. Our approach integrates multi-granularity contextual analysis with a multi-agent reasoning architecture to systematically evaluate the consistency and integrity of multi-modal news content. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness and resilience of EXCLAIM, demonstrating its ability to detect OOC misinformation with 4.3% higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while offering explainable and actionable insights.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

The lack of a benchmark for mixed-source misinformation has hindered progress in this field. To address this, we introduce MMFakeBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for mixed-source MMD. MMFakeBench includes 3 critical sources: textual veracity distortion, visual veracity distortion, and cross-modal consistency distortion, along with 12 sub-categories of misinformation forgery types. We further conduct an extensive evaluation of 6 prevalent detection methods and 15 Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on MMFakeBench under a zero-shot setting. The results indicate that current methods struggle under this challenging and realistic mixed-source MMD setting. Additionally, we propose MMD-Agent, a novel approach to integrate the reasoning, action, and tool-use capabilities of LVLM agents, significantly enhancing accuracy and generalization. We believe this study will catalyze future research into more realistic mixed-source multimodal misinformation and provide a fair evaluation of misinformation detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025, Project page: https://liuxuannan.github.io/MMFakeBench.github.io/</p></details> |

We evaluate multiple GenAI models across tasks that involve the rating of, and perceived reasoning about, the credibility of information. The information in our experiments comes from content that subnational U.S. politicians post to Facebook. We find that GPT-4o, one of the most used AI models in consumer applications, outperforms other models, but all models exhibit only moderate agreement with human coders. Importantly, even when GenAI models accurately identify low-credibility content, their reasoning relies heavily on linguistic features and ``hard'' criteria, such as the level of detail, source reliability, and language formality, rather than an understanding of veracity. We also assess the effectiveness of summarized versus full content inputs, finding that summarized content holds promise for improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. While GenAI has the potential to support human fact-checkers in scaling misinformation detection, our results caution against relying solely on these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 17th ACM Web Science Conference 2025</p></details> |

This issue particularly affects domains that rely heavily on trustworthy data, such as journalism, forensic analysis, and Earth observation. To address these concerns, the ability to geolocate a non-geo-tagged ground-view image without external information, such as GPS coordinates, has become increasingly critical. This study tackles the challenge of linking a ground-view image, potentially exhibiting varying fields of view (FoV), to its corresponding satellite image without the aid of GPS data. To achieve this, we propose a novel four-stream Siamese-like architecture, the Quadruple Semantic Align Net (SAN-QUAD), which extends previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches by leveraging semantic segmentation applied to both ground and satellite imagery. Experimental results on a subset of the CVUSA dataset demonstrate significant improvements of up to 9.8% over prior methods across various FoV settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

| **[E2LVLM:Evidence-Enhanced Large Vision-Language Model for Multimodal Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10455v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive advancements in multimodal Out-of-Context (OOC) misinformation detection, discerning whether an authentic image is wrongly used in a claim. Despite their success, the textual evidence of authentic images retrieved from the inverse search is directly transmitted to LVLMs, leading to inaccurate or false information in the decision-making phase. To this end, we present E2LVLM, a novel evidence-enhanced large vision-language model by adapting textual evidence in two levels. First, motivated by the fact that textual evidence provided by external tools struggles to align with LVLMs inputs, we devise a reranking and rewriting strategy for generating coherent and contextually attuned content, thereby driving the aligned and effective behavior of LVLMs pertinent to authentic images. Second, to address the scarcity of news domain datasets with both judgment and explanation, we generate a novel OOC multimodal instruction-following dataset by prompting LVLMs with informative content to acquire plausible explanations. Further, we develop a multimodal instruction-tuning strategy with convincing explanations for beyond detection. This scheme contributes to E2LVLM for multimodal OOC misinformation detection and explanation. A multitude of experiments demonstrate that E2LVLM achieves superior performance than state-of-the-art methods, and also provides compelling rationales for judgments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Annotator Reliability Assessment and Sample Weighting for Knowledge-Based Misinformation Detection on Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14515v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spreads rapidly on social media, confusing the truth and targeting potentially vulnerable people. To effectively mitigate the negative impact of misinformation, it must first be accurately detected before applying a mitigation strategy, such as X's community notes, which is currently a manual process. This study takes a knowledge-based approach to misinformation detection, modelling the problem similarly to one of natural language inference. The EffiARA annotation framework is introduced, aiming to utilise inter- and intra-annotator agreement to understand the reliability of each annotator and influence the training of large language models for classification based on annotator reliability. In assessing the EffiARA annotation framework, the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict Knowledge-Based Misinformation Classification Dataset (RUC-MCD) was developed and made publicly available. This study finds that sample weighting using annotator reliability performs the best, utilising both inter- and intra-annotator agreement and soft-label training. The highest classification performance achieved using Llama-3.2-1B was a macro-F1 of 0.757 and 0.740 using TwHIN-BERT-large.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

In the financial domain, the accuracy of information is crucial for various aspects of financial market, which has made financial misinformation detection (FMD) an urgent problem that needs to be addressed. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various fields. However, current studies mostly rely on traditional methods and have not explored the application of LLMs in the field of FMD. The main reason is the lack of FMD instruction tuning datasets and evaluation benchmarks. In this paper, we propose FMDLlama, the first open-sourced instruction-following LLMs for FMD task based on fine-tuning Llama3.1 with instruction data, the first multi-task FMD instruction dataset (FMDID) to support LLM instruction tuning, and a comprehensive FMD evaluation benchmark (FMD-B) with classification and explanation generation tasks to test the FMD ability of LLMs. We compare our models with a variety of LLMs on FMD-B, where our model outperforms other open-sourced LLMs as well as OpenAI's products.

| **[SoK: Machine Learning for Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12215v4)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We examine the disconnect between scholarship and practice in applying machine learning to trust and safety problems, using misinformation detection as a case study. We survey literature on automated detection of misinformation across a corpus of 248 well-cited papers in the field. We then examine subsets of papers for data and code availability, design missteps, reproducibility, and generalizability. Our paper corpus includes published work in security, natural language processing, and computational social science. Across these disparate disciplines, we identify common errors in dataset and method design. In general, detection tasks are often meaningfully distinct from the challenges that online services actually face. Datasets and model evaluation are often non-representative of real-world contexts, and evaluation frequently is not independent of model training. We demonstrate the limitations of current detection methods in a series of three representative replication studies. Based on the results of these analyses and our literature survey, we conclude that the current state-of-the-art in fully-automated misinformation detection has limited efficacy in detecting human-generated misinformation. We offer recommendations for evaluating applications of machine learning to trust and safety problems and recommend future directions for research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating GenAI-powered Evidence Pollution for Out-of-Context Multimodal Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14728v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models have achieved significant success, they also raise growing concerns about online information security due to their potential misuse for generating deceptive content. Out-of-context (OOC) multimodal misinformation detection, which often retrieves Web evidence to identify the repurposing of images in false contexts, faces the issue of reasoning over GenAI-polluted evidence to derive accurate predictions. Existing works simulate GenAI-powered pollution at the claim level with stylistic rewriting to conceal linguistic cues, and ignore evidence-level pollution for such information-seeking applications. In this work, we investigate how polluted evidence affects the performance of existing OOC detectors, revealing a performance degradation of more than 9 percentage points. We propose two strategies, cross-modal evidence reranking and cross-modal claim-evidence reasoning, to address the challenges posed by polluted evidence. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that these strategies can effectively enhance the robustness of existing out-of-context detectors amidst polluted evidence.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

Since fake news can belong to different domains like politics, sports, etc. with their unique characteristics, inference on a test image-caption pair is contingent on how well the model has been trained on similar data. Since training individual models for each domain is not practical, we propose a novel framework termed DPOD (Domain-specific Prompt tuning using Out-of-domain data), which can exploit out-of-domain data during training to improve fake news detection of all desired domains simultaneously. First, to compute generalizable features, we modify the Vision-Language Model, CLIP to extract features that helps to align the representations of the images and corresponding captions of both the in-domain and out-of-domain data in a label-aware manner. Further, we propose a domain-specific prompt learning technique which leverages training samples of all the available domains based on the extent they can be useful to the desired domain. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks demonstrate that DPOD achieves state of-the-art performance for this challenging task.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to explore the performance of LLMs on misinformation detection tasks. This study stands as the pioneering investigation into the understanding capabilities of multiple LLMs regarding both content and propagation across social media platforms. Our empirical studies on eight misinformation detection datasets show that LLM-based detectors can achieve comparable performance in text-based misinformation detection but exhibit notably constrained capabilities in comprehending propagation structure compared to existing models in propagation-based misinformation detection. Our experiments further demonstrate that LLMs exhibit great potential to enhance existing misinformation detection models. These findings highlight the potential ability of LLMs to detect misinformation.</p></details> |  |

Perhaps, the impact of this age-old problem is presently most plain in politics and healthcare. However, fake news is affecting an increasing number of domains. It takes many different forms and continues to shapeshift as technology advances. Though it arguably most widely spreads in textual form, e.g., through social media posts and blog articles. Thus, it is imperative to thwart the spread of textual misinformation, which necessitates its initial detection. This thesis contributes to the creation of representations that are useful for detecting misinformation. Firstly, it develops a novel method for extracting textual features from news articles for misinformation detection. These features harness the disparity between the thematic coherence of authentic and false news stories. In other words, the composition of themes discussed in both groups significantly differs as the story progresses. Secondly, it demonstrates the effectiveness of topic features for fake news detection, using classification and clustering. Clustering is particularly useful because it alleviates the need for a labelled dataset, which can be labour-intensive and time-consuming to amass. More generally, it contributes towards a better understanding of misinformation and ways of detecting it using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Masters Thesis, 106 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

Meanwhile, the need to systematically understand how LLMs can further revolutionize the field also becomes urgent. In this work, we--a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning computer science and political science--present the first principled framework termed Political-LLM to advance the comprehensive understanding of integrating LLMs into computational political science. Specifically, we first introduce a fundamental taxonomy classifying the existing explorations into two perspectives: political science and computational methodologies. In particular, from the political science perspective, we highlight the role of LLMs in automating predictive and generative tasks, simulating behavior dynamics, and improving causal inference through tools like counterfactual generation; from a computational perspective, we introduce advancements in data preparation, fine-tuning, and evaluation methods for LLMs that are tailored to political contexts. We identify key challenges and future directions, emphasizing the development of domain-specific datasets, addressing issues of bias and fairness, incorporating human expertise, and redefining evaluation criteria to align with the unique requirements of computational political science. Political-LLM seeks to serve as a guidebook for researchers to foster an informed, ethical, and impactful use of Artificial Intelligence in political science.

Through a series of experiments on two fact-checking datasets, we demonstrate that while multimodality can enhance performance, fusing separate embeddings from text and image encoders yielded superior results compared to using VLM embeddings. Furthermore, the proposed neural classifier significantly outperformed KNN and SVM baselines in leveraging extracted embeddings, highlighting its effectiveness for multimodal fact-checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLING2025</p></details> |

| **[Verifying the Robustness of Automatic Credibility Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08032v3)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text classification methods have been widely investigated as a way to detect content of low credibility: fake news, social media bots, propaganda, etc. Quite accurate models (likely based on deep neural networks) help in moderating public electronic platforms and often cause content creators to face rejection of their submissions or removal of already published texts. Having the incentive to evade further detection, content creators try to come up with a slightly modified version of the text (known as an attack with an adversarial example) that exploit the weaknesses of classifiers and result in a different output. Here we systematically test the robustness of common text classifiers against available attacking techniques and discover that, indeed, meaning-preserving changes in input text can mislead the models. The approaches we test focus on finding vulnerable spans in text and replacing individual characters or words, taking into account the similarity between the original and replacement content. We also introduce BODEGA: a benchmark for testing both victim models and attack methods on four misinformation detection tasks in an evaluation framework designed to simulate real use-cases of content moderation. The attacked tasks include (1) fact checking and detection of (2) hyperpartisan news, (3) propaganda and (4) rumours. Our experimental results show that modern large language models are often more vulnerable to attacks than previous, smaller solutions, e.g. attacks on GEMMA being up to 27\% more successful than those on BERT. Finally, we manually analyse a subset adversarial examples and check what kinds of modifications are used in successful attacks.</p></details> |  |

Automating the extraction of credibility signals presents significant challenges due to the necessity of training high-accuracy, signal-specific extractors, coupled with the lack of sufficiently large annotated datasets. This paper introduces Pastel (Prompted weAk Supervision wiTh crEdibility signaLs), a weakly supervised approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract credibility signals from web content, and subsequently combines them to predict the veracity of content without relying on human supervision. We validate our approach using four article-level misinformation detection datasets, demonstrating that Pastel outperforms zero-shot veracity detection by 38.3% and achieves 86.7% of the performance of the state-of-the-art system trained with human supervision. Moreover, in cross-domain settings where training and testing datasets originate from different domains, Pastel significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised model by 63%. We further study the association between credibility signals and veracity, and perform an ablation study showing the impact of each signal on model performance. Our findings reveal that 12 out of the 19 proposed signals exhibit strong associations with veracity across all datasets, while some signals show domain-specific strengths.</p></details> |  |

To combat misinformation, current research relies on professionals like journalists and fact-checkers for annotating and debunking misinformation, and develops automated machine learning methods for detecting misinformation. Complementary to these approaches, recent research has increasingly concentrated on utilizing the power of ordinary social media users, a.k.a. "crowd", who act as eyes-on-the-ground proactively questioning and countering misinformation. Notably, recent studies show that 96% of counter-misinformation responses originate from them. Acknowledging their prominent role, we present the first systematic and comprehensive survey of research papers that actively leverage the crowds to combat misinformation. We first identify 88 papers related to crowd-based efforts, following a meticulous annotation process adhering to the PRISMA framework. We then present key statistics related to misinformation, counter-misinformation, and crowd input in different formats and topics. Upon holistic analysis of the papers, we introduce a novel taxonomy of the roles played by the crowds: (i)annotators who actively identify misinformation; (ii)evaluators who assess counter-misinformation effectiveness; (iii)creators who create counter-misinformation. This taxonomy explores the crowd's capabilities in misinformation detection, identifies prerequisites for effective counter-misinformation, and analyzes crowd-generated counter-misinformation. Then, we delve into (i)distinguishing individual, collaborative, and machine-assisted labeling for annotators; (ii)analyzing the effectiveness of counter-misinformation through surveys, interviews, and in-lab experiments for evaluators; and (iii)characterizing creation patterns and creator profiles for creators.

We present CrediRAG, the first fake news detection model that combines language models with access to a rich external political knowledge base with a dense social network to detect fake news across social media at scale. CrediRAG uses a news retriever to initially assign a misinformation score to each post based on the source credibility of similar news articles to the post title content. CrediRAG then improves the initial retrieval estimations through a novel weighted post-to-post network connected based on shared commenters and weighted by the average stance of all shared commenters across every pair of posts. We achieve 11% increase in the F1-score in detecting misinformative posts over state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments conducted on curated real-world Reddit data of over 200,000 posts demonstrate the superior performance of CrediRAG on existing baselines. Thus, our approach offers a more accurate and scalable solution to combat the spread of fake news across social media platforms.</p></details> |  |

Prior works have utilized this platform to extract epidemic-related information (e.g. infections, preventive measures) to provide early warnings for epidemic prediction. However, these works only focused on English posts, while epidemics can occur anywhere in the world, and early discussions are often in the local, non-English languages. In this work, we introduce the first multilingual Event Extraction (EE) framework SPEED++ for extracting epidemic event information for a wide range of diseases and languages. To this end, we extend a previous epidemic ontology with 20 argument roles; and curate our multilingual EE dataset SPEED++ comprising 5.1K tweets in four languages for four diseases. Annotating data in every language is infeasible; thus we develop zero-shot cross-lingual cross-disease models (i.e., training only on English COVID data) utilizing multilingual pre-training and show their efficacy in extracting epidemic-related events for 65 diverse languages across different diseases. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can provide epidemic warnings for COVID-19 in its earliest stages in Dec 2019 (3 weeks before global discussions) from Chinese Weibo posts without any training in Chinese. Furthermore, we exploit our framework's argument extraction capabilities to aggregate community epidemic discussions like symptoms and cure measures, aiding misinformation detection and public attention monitoring. Overall, we lay a strong foundation for multilingual epidemic preparedness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Our approach is robust across multiple models, outperforming alternatives and increasing the macro F1 of misinformation detection by as much as 20 percent compared to LLMs without search. We also conduct extensive analyses on the sources our system leverages and their biases, decisions in the construction of the system like the search tool and the knowledge base, the type of evidence needed and its impact on the results, and other parts of the overall process. By combining strong performance with in-depth understanding, we hope to provide building blocks for future search-enabled misinformation mitigation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>1 mai...</summary><p>1 main figure, 8 tables, 10 pages, 12 figures in Appendix, 7 tables in Appendix GitHub URL: https://github.com/ComplexData-MILA/webretrieval</p></details> |

The study trained and tested various ML classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc.), DL models (CNN, LSTM, hybrid CNN+LSTM), and pretrained language models (DistilBERT, RoBERTa) on the "COVID19-FNIR DATASET". These models were evaluated for accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision, and ROC, and used preprocessing techniques like stemming and lemmatization. The results showed SVM performed well, achieving a 94.41% F1-score. DL models with Word2Vec embeddings exceeded 98% in all performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision & ROC). The CNN+LSTM hybrid models also exceeded 98% across performance metrics, outperforming pretrained models like DistilBERT and RoBERTa. Our study concludes that DL and hybrid DL models are more effective than conventional ML algorithms for detecting COVID-19 misinformation on OSNs. The findings highlight the importance of advanced neural network approaches and large-scale pretraining in misinformation detection. Future research should optimize these models for various misinformation types and adapt to changing OSNs, aiding in combating health misinformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 tables presented at the OASIS workshop of the ACM Hypertext and Social Media Conference 2024</p></details> |

Existing approaches for this task assume the availability of large amounts of labeled data, which is often impractical in real-world, since it requires extensive manual intervention and domain expertise. In contrast, since obtaining a large corpus of unlabeled image-text pairs is much easier, here, we propose a semi-supervised protocol, where the model has access to a limited number of labeled image-text pairs and a large corpus of unlabeled pairs. Additionally, the occurrence of fake news being much lesser compared to the real ones, the datasets tend to be highly imbalanced, thus making the task even more challenging. Towards this goal, we propose a novel framework, Consensus from Vision-Language Models (CoVLM), which generates robust pseudo-labels for unlabeled pairs using thresholds derived from the labeled data. This approach can automatically determine the right threshold parameters of the model for selecting the confident pseudo-labels. Experimental results on benchmark datasets across challenging conditions and comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACCV 2024</p></details> |

The rapid online information exchange necessitates advanced detection mechanisms to mitigate misinformation-induced harm. Existing research, however, has predominantly focused on assessing veracity, overlooking the legal implications and social consequences of misinformation. In this work, we take a novel angle to consolidate the definition of misinformation detection using legal issues as a measurement of societal ramifications, aiming to bring interdisciplinary efforts to tackle misinformation and its consequence. We introduce a new task: Misinformation with Legal Consequence (MisLC), which leverages definitions from a wide range of legal domains covering 4 broader legal topics and 11 fine-grained legal issues, including hate speech, election laws, and privacy regulations. For this task, we advocate a two-step dataset curation approach that utilizes crowd-sourced checkworthiness and expert evaluations of misinformation. We provide insights about the MisLC task through empirical evidence, from the problem definition to experiments and expert involvement. While the latest large language models and retrieval-augmented generation are effective baselines for the task, we find they are still far from replicating expert performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8.5 p...</summary><p>8.5 pages of main body, 20 pages total; Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Obtaining large-scale, high-quality real-world fact-checking datasets for training detectors is costly, leading researchers to use synthetic datasets generated by AI technologies. However, the generalizability of detectors trained on synthetic data to real-world scenarios remains unclear due to the distribution gap. To address this, we propose learning from synthetic data for detecting real-world multimodal misinformation through two model-agnostic data selection methods that match synthetic and real-world data distributions. Experiments show that our method enhances the performance of a small MLLM (13B) on real-world fact-checking datasets, enabling it to even surpass GPT-4V~\cite{GPT-4V}.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

Taking advantage of the fact that visual modalities such as images and videos are more favorable and attractive to the users and textual contents are sometimes skimmed carelessly, misinformation spreaders have recently targeted contextual connections between the modalities e.g., text and image. Hence many researchers have developed automatic techniques for detecting possible cross-modal discordance in web-based content. We analyze, categorize and identify existing approaches in addition to challenges and shortcomings they face in order to unearth new research opportunities in the field of multi-modal misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpMis: An Investigation of Synthetic Spoken Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11308v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, speech generation technology has advanced rapidly, fueled by generative models and large-scale training techniques. While these developments have enabled the production of high-quality synthetic speech, they have also raised concerns about the misuse of this technology, particularly for generating synthetic misinformation. Current research primarily focuses on distinguishing machine-generated speech from human-produced speech, but the more urgent challenge is detecting misinformation within spoken content. This task requires a thorough analysis of factors such as speaker identity, topic, and synthesis. To address this need, we conduct an initial investigation into synthetic spoken misinformation detection by introducing an open-source dataset, SpMis. SpMis includes speech synthesized from over 1,000 speakers across five common topics, utilizing state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems. Although our results show promising detection capabilities, they also reveal substantial challenges for practical implementation, underscoring the importance of ongoing research in this critical area.</p></details> | Accepted in SLT 2024 |

While existing multimodal detection approaches have achieved high performance, the lack of interpretability hinders these systems' reliability and practical deployment. Inspired by NeuralSymbolic AI which combines the learning ability of neural networks with the explainability of symbolic learning, we propose a novel logic-based neural model for multimodal misinformation detection which integrates interpretable logic clauses to express the reasoning process of the target task. To make learning effective, we parameterize symbolic logical elements using neural representations, which facilitate the automatic generation and evaluation of meaningful logic clauses. Additionally, to make our framework generalizable across diverse misinformation sources, we introduce five meta-predicates that can be instantiated with different correlations. Results on three public datasets (Twitter, Weibo, and Sarcasm) demonstrate the feasibility and versatility of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of ACL 23. 9 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Sequential Classification of Misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04860v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years there have been a growing interest in online auditing of information flow over social networks with the goal of monitoring undesirable effects, such as, misinformation and fake news. Most previous work on the subject, focus on the binary classification problem of classifying information as fake or genuine. Nonetheless, in many practical scenarios, the multi-class/label setting is of particular importance. For example, it could be the case that a social media platform may want to distinguish between ``true", ``partly-true", and ``false" information. Accordingly, in this paper, we consider the problem of online multiclass classification of information flow. To that end, driven by empirical studies on information flow over real-world social media networks, we propose a probabilistic information flow model over graphs. Then, the learning task is to detect the label of the information flow, with the goal of minimizing a combination of the classification error and the detection time. For this problem, we propose two detection algorithms; the first is based on the well-known multiple sequential probability ratio test, while the second is a novel graph neural network based sequential decision algorithm. For both algorithms, we prove several strong statistical guarantees. We also construct a data driven algorithm for learning the proposed probabilistic model. Finally, we test our algorithms over two real-world datasets, and show that they outperform other state-of-the-art misinformation detection algorithms, in terms of detection time and classification error.</p></details> | 42 pages |

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges, yet they struggle to accurately interpret human emotions and complex content such as misinformation. This paper introduces MM-Soc, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of multimodal social media content. MM-Soc compiles prominent multimodal datasets and incorporates a novel large-scale YouTube tagging dataset, targeting a range of tasks from misinformation detection, hate speech detection, and social context generation. Through our exhaustive evaluation on ten size-variants of four open-source MLLMs, we have identified significant performance disparities, highlighting the need for advancements in models' social understanding capabilities. Our analysis reveals that, in a zero-shot setting, various types of MLLMs generally exhibit difficulties in handling social media tasks. However, MLLMs demonstrate performance improvements post fine-tuning, suggesting potential pathways for improvement.

Social media data often contains multimodal information which includes audio, video, text, and images. However, existing multimodal misinformation detection methods tend to focus only on some of these modalities, failing to comprehensively address information from all modalities. To comprehensively address the various modal information that may appear on social media, this paper constructs a comprehensive multimodal misinformation detection framework. By employing corresponding neural network encoders for each modality, the framework can fuse different modality information and support the multimodal misinformation detection task. Based on the constructed framework, this paper explores the importance of the audio modality in multimodal misinformation detection tasks on social media. By adjusting the architecture of the acoustic encoder, the effectiveness of different acoustic feature encoders in the multimodal misinformation detection tasks is investigated. Furthermore, this paper discovers that audio and video information must be carefully aligned, otherwise the misalignment across different audio and video modalities can severely impair the model performance.</p></details> |  |

Predicting the original meta-context of visual misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09939v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To assist human fact-checkers, researchers have developed automated approaches for visual misinformation detection. These methods assign veracity scores by identifying inconsistencies between the image and its caption, or by detecting forgeries in the image. However, they neglect a crucial point of the human fact-checking process: identifying the original meta-context of the image. By explaining what is actually true about the image, fact-checkers can better detect misinformation, focus their efforts on check-worthy visual content, engage in counter-messaging before misinformation spreads widely, and make their explanation more convincing. Here, we fill this gap by introducing the task of automated image contextualization. We create 5Pils, a dataset of 1,676 fact-checked images with question-answer pairs about their original meta-context. Annotations are based on the 5 Pillars fact-checking framework. We implement a first baseline that grounds the image in its original meta-context using the content of the image and textual evidence retrieved from the open web. Our experiments show promising results while highlighting several open challenges in retrieval and reasoning. We make our code and data publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Code available at https://github.com/UKPLab/5pils</p></details> |

Existing approaches, such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1, the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools. Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.</p></details> |  |

Adaptive-depth methods can improve efficiency, but prior approaches rely on costly inference-time search, architectural changes, or large-scale retraining, and in practice often degrade accuracy despite efficiency gains. We introduce Dr.LLM, Dynamic routing of Layers for LLMs, a retrofittable framework that equips pretrained models with lightweight per-layer routers deciding to skip, execute, or repeat a block. Routers are trained with explicit supervision: using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive high-quality layer configurations that preserve or improve accuracy under a compute budget. Our design, windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing, and bottleneck MLP routers, ensures robustness under class imbalance and long sequences. On ARC (logic) and DART (math), Dr.LLM improves accuracy by up to +3.4%p while saving 5 layers per example on average. Routers generalize to out-of-domain tasks (MMLU, GSM8k, AIME, TruthfulQA, SQuADv2, GPQA, PIQA, AGIEval) with only 0.85% accuracy drop while retaining efficiency, and outperform prior routing methods by up to +7.7%p. Overall, Dr.LLM shows that explicitly supervised routers retrofit frozen LLMs for budget-aware, accuracy-driven inference without altering base weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, Under submission</p></details> |

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) overcomes this historical barrier, allowing applications developers to instantly govern model behavior by editing prompt instructions. This shift enables a new paradigm: data-model co-evolution, where a living test set and a model's instructions evolve in tandem. We operationalize this paradigm in an interactive system designed to address the critical challenge of encoding subtle, domain-specific policies into prompt instructions. The system's structured workflow guides people to discover edge cases, articulate rationales for desired behavior, and iteratively evaluate instruction revisions against a growing test set. A user study shows our workflow helps participants refine instructions systematically and specify ambiguous policies more concretely. This work points toward more robust and responsible LLM applications through human-in-the-loop development aligned with local preferences and policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[CARVQ: Corrective Adaptor with Group Residual Vector Quantization for LLM Embedding Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12721v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B, LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices. This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs on edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP Findings 2025</p></details> |
| **[Generation Space Size: Understanding and Calibrating Open-Endedness of LLM Generations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12699v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Different open-ended generation tasks require different degrees of output diversity. However, current LLMs are often miscalibrated. They collapse to overly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinate diverse but incorrect responses for factual tasks. We argue that these two failure modes are unified by, and can both be addressed by, the notion of effective generation space size (GSS) -- the set of semantically distinct outputs a model considers for a prompt. We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with ground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where models diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection metrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity and uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals, providing interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations. We demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and predicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting overthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to expand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Debate for LLM Judges with Adaptive Stability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12697v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Delegates to Trustees: How Optimizing for Long-Term Interests Shapes Bias and Alignment in LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12689v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising accuracy in predicting survey responses and policy preferences, which has increased interest in their potential to represent human interests in various domains. Most existing research has focused on behavioral cloning, effectively evaluating how well models reproduce individuals' expressed preferences. Drawing on theories of political representation, we highlight an underexplored design trade-off: whether AI systems should act as delegates, mirroring expressed preferences, or as trustees, exercising judgment about what best serves an individual's interests. This trade-off is closely related to issues of LLM sycophancy, where models can encourage behavior or validate beliefs that may be aligned with a user's short-term preferences, but is detrimental to their long-term interests. Through a series of experiments simulating votes on various policy issues in the U.S. context, we apply a temporal utility framework that weighs short and long-term interests (simulating a trustee role) and compare voting outcomes to behavior-cloning models (simulating a delegate). We find that trustee-style predictions weighted toward long-term interests produce policy decisions that align more closely with expert consensus on well-understood issues, but also show greater bias toward models' default stances on topics lacking clear agreement. These findings reveal a fundamental trade-off in designing AI systems to represent human interests. Delegate models better preserve user autonomy but may diverge from well-supported policy positions, while trustee models can promote welfare on well-understood issues yet risk paternalism and bias on subjective topics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying Hybrid Thinking: Can LLMs Truly Switch Between Think and No-Think?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12680v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2) using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that, compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500) and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from $5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

However, in domains aiming for carbon neutrality and high-performance renewable energy systems, current AI-assisted design automation methods face critical challenges in explainability, scalability, and practical usability. To address these limitations, we introduce PHIA (Physics-Informed Autonomous Agent), an LLM-driven system that automates modulation design for power converters in Power Electronics Systems with minimal human intervention. In contrast to traditional pipeline-based methods, PHIA incorporates an LLM-based planning module that interactively acquires and verifies design requirements via a user-friendly chat interface. This planner collaborates with physics-informed simulation and optimization components to autonomously generate and iteratively refine modulation designs. The interactive interface also supports interpretability by providing textual explanations and visual outputs throughout the design process. Experimental results show that PHIA reduces standard mean absolute error by 63.2% compared to the second-best benchmark and accelerates the overall design process by over 33 times. A user study involving 20 domain experts further confirms PHIA's superior design efficiency and usability, highlighting its potential to transform industrial design workflows in power electronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 Innovative Applications of AI</p></details> |

Although existing compression methods reduce memory by evaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic relationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded performance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache compression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as basic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures and contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even under aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index reuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved indices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by 26.5\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench, Needle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\% in precision while maintaining the same compression ratio. These results confirm that semantic-aware compression significantly enhances both efficiency and performance for long-context LLM inference, providing a simple yet effective solution to the memory bottleneck problem.

However, the knowledge updating mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and small-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying certain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data increases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation, plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our findings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable strategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[StyleDecipher: Robust and Explainable Detection of LLM-Generated Texts with Stylistic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12608v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into open-domain writing, detecting machine-generated text has become a critical task for ensuring content authenticity and trust. Existing approaches rely on statistical discrepancies or model-specific heuristics to distinguish between LLM-generated and human-written text. However, these methods struggle in real-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to paraphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic diversity or hybrid human-AI authorship. In this work, we propose StyleDecipher, a robust and explainable detection framework that revisits LLM-generated text detection using combined feature extractors to quantify stylistic differences. By jointly modeling discrete stylistic indicators and continuous stylistic representations derived from semantic embeddings, StyleDecipher captures distinctive style-level divergences between human and LLM outputs within a unified representation space. This framework enables accurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access to model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five diverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts, demonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain accuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing baselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial perturbations and mixed human-AI content. Further qualitative and quantitative analysis confirms that stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for distinguishing machine-generated text.

| **[Clean First, Align Later: Benchmarking Preference Data Cleaning for Reliable LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23564v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent, which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research: https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/PrefCleanBench.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, applying IBN effectively to the RAN scheduler [...] remains a significant challenge. Current approaches predominantly rely on coarse-grained network slicing, lacking the granularity for dynamic adaptation to individual user conditions and traffic patterns. Despite the existence of a vast body of scheduling algorithms [...], their practical utilization is hindered by implementation heterogeneity, insufficient systematic evaluation in production environments, and the complexity of developing high-performance scheduler implementations.[...] To address these limitations, we propose ALLSTaR (Automated LLm-driven Scheduler generation and Testing for intent-based RAN), a novel framework leveraging LLMs for automated, intent-driven scheduler design, implementation, and evaluation. ALLSTaR interprets NL intents, automatically generates functional scheduler code from the research literature using OCR and LLMs, and intelligently matches operator intents to the most suitable scheduler(s). Our implementation deploys these schedulers as O-RAN dApps, enabling on-the-fly deployment and testing on a production-grade, 5G-compliant testbed. This approach has enabled the largest-scale OTA experimental comparison of 18 scheduling algorithms automatically synthesized from the academic literature. The resulting performance profiles serve as the input for our Intent-Based Scheduling (IBS) framework, which dynamically selects and deploys appropriate schedulers that optimally satisfy operator intents. We validate our approach through multiple use cases unattainable with current slicing-based optimization techniques, demonstrating fine-grained control based on buffer status, physical layer conditions, and heterogeneous traffic types</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under submission to an IEEE journal, copyright may change without notice</p></details> |
| **[MooseAgent: A LLM Based Multi-agent Framework for Automating Moose Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08621v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used in engineering and scientific computing, but its pre-processing, solver configuration, and post-processing stages are often time-consuming and require specialized knowledge. This paper proposes an automated solution framework, MooseAgent, for the multi-physics simulation framework MOOSE, which combines large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs) with a multi-agent system. The framework uses LLMs to understand user-described simulation requirements in natural language and employs task decomposition and multi-round iterative verification strategies to automatically generate MOOSE input files. To improve accuracy and reduce model hallucinations, the system builds and utilizes a vector database containing annotated MOOSE input cards and function documentation. We conducted experimental evaluations on several typical cases, including heat transfer, mechanics, phase field, and multi-physics coupling. The results show that MooseAgent can automate the MOOSE simulation process to a certain extent, especially demonstrating a high success rate when dealing with relatively simple single-physics problems. The main contribution of this research is the proposal of a multi-agent automated framework for MOOSE, which validates its potential in simplifying finite element simulation processes and lowering the user barrier, providing new ideas for the development of intelligent finite element simulation software. The code for the MooseAgent framework proposed in this paper has been open-sourced and is available at https://github.com/taozhan18/MooseAgent</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 Figs |

Large language models (LLMs) introduce new dimensions to these challenges through their ability to generate persuasive content at scale and reinforcing existing biases. This study investigates the bidirectional persuasion dynamics between LLMs and humans when exposed to misinformative content. We analyze human-to-LLM influence using human-stance datasets and assess LLM-to-human influence by generating LLM-based persuasive arguments. Additionally, we use a multi-agent LLM framework to analyze the spread of misinformation under persuasion among demographic-oriented LLM agents. Our findings show that demographic factors influence susceptibility to misinformation in LLMs, closely reflecting the demographic-based patterns seen in human susceptibility. We also find that, similar to human demographic groups, multi-agent LLMs exhibit echo chamber behavior. This research explores the interplay between humans and LLMs, highlighting demographic differences in the context of misinformation and offering insights for future interventions.</p></details> |  |

However, the impartiality of these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e., GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11 types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores. Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, synchronizing gradients in data parallel setups introduces communication overhead that grows with the number of workers, limiting parallelization efficiency. Local optimization algorithms reduce communications but incur high memory costs as they prevent optimizer state sharding, hindering scalability. To address this, we propose \textbf{AC}cumulate while \textbf{CO}mmunicate (ACCO), a memory-efficient optimization algorithm for distributed LLM training. By synchronizing delayed gradients while computing new ones, ACCO reduces GPU idle time and supports heterogeneous hardware. To mitigate the convergence issues caused by delayed updates, we introduce a novel technique ensuring training dynamics align with standard distributed optimization. Compared to ZeRO-1, our approach is significantly faster and scales effectively across heterogeneous hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[MTOS: A LLM-Driven Multi-topic Opinion Simulation Framework for Exploring Echo Chamber Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12423v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models, meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation (MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory, incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS, varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource competition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically simulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts, and capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and system stability.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11figures |

Travel agencies are eager to offload this error-prone task onto AI systems; however, deploying LLMs without verified reliability could result in significant financial losses and erode customer trust. PricingLogic comprises 300 natural-language questions based on booking requests derived from 42 real-world pricing policies, spanning two levels of difficulty: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii)bundled-tour calculations involving interacting discounts. Evaluations of a line of LLMs reveal a steep performance drop on the harder tier,exposing systematic failures in rule interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.These results highlight that, despite their general capabilities, today's LLMs remain unreliable in revenue-critical applications without further safeguards or domain adaptation. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/PricingLogic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Graph Descriptive Order Affect Solving Graph Problems with LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07140v6)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in reasoning tasks, including mathematical reasoning and logical deduction. Among these reasoning tasks, graph problems stand out due to their complexity and unique structural characteristics, attracting considerable attention from researchers. Previous studies have explored LLMs' graph reasoning abilities through various techniques, such as different encoding methods for graph structures and the use of carefully designed prompts. However, a critical factor has been mostly overlooked: the prompt sequential order in which graph descriptions are presented to the models. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of how the order of graph descriptions impacts LLM performance. Specifically, we comprehensively evaluate four graph description orders across six graph problems using six mainstream LLMs. The results reveal that: (1) ordered graph descriptions significantly improve LLMs' comprehension of graph structures; (2) the robustness of LLMs to graph description order varies across different tasks; and (3) the impact of graph order on performance is closely related to the inherent characteristics of tasks. This study provides a critical advancement in the application of LLMs for solving graph-related problems, paving the way for future research to optimize model performance through strategic graph description ordering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |
| **[Tokenization Disparities as Infrastructure Bias: How Subword Systems Create Inequities in LLM Access and Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12389v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tokenization disparities pose a significant barrier to achieving equitable access to artificial intelligence across linguistically diverse populations. This study conducts a large-scale cross-linguistic evaluation of tokenization efficiency in over 200 languages to systematically quantify computational inequities in large language models (LLMs). Using a standardized experimental framework, we applied consistent preprocessing and normalization protocols, followed by uniform tokenization through the tiktoken library across all language samples. Comprehensive tokenization statistics were collected using established evaluation metrics, including Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC), benchmarked against English baselines. Our cross-linguistic analysis reveals substantial and systematic disparities: Latin-script languages consistently exhibit higher tokenization efficiency, while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages incur significantly greater token inflation, often 3-5 times higher RTC ratios. These inefficiencies translate into increased computational costs and reduced effective context utilization for underrepresented languages. Overall, the findings highlight structural inequities in current AI systems, where speakers of low-resource and non-Latin languages face disproportionate computational disadvantages. Future research should prioritize the development of linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary construction methods that incorporate typological diversity, ensuring more inclusive and computationally equitable multilingual AI systems.</p></details> | 6 pages 4 figures |
| **[LLM-REVal: Can We Trust LLM Reviewers Yet?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12367v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has inspired researchers to integrate them extensively into the academic workflow, potentially reshaping how research is practiced and reviewed. While previous studies highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting research and peer review, their dual roles in the academic workflow and the complex interplay between research and review bring new risks that remain largely underexplored. In this study, we focus on how the deep integration of LLMs into both peer-review and research processes may influence scholarly fairness, examining the potential risks of using LLMs as reviewers by simulation. This simulation incorporates a research agent, which generates papers and revises, alongside a review agent, which assesses the submissions. Based on the simulation results, we conduct human annotations and identify pronounced misalignment between LLM-based reviews and human judgments: (1) LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores for LLM-authored papers, assigning them markedly higher scores than human-authored ones; (2) LLM reviewers persistently underrate human-authored papers with critical statements (e.g., risk, fairness), even after multiple revisions. Our analysis reveals that these stem from two primary biases in LLM reviewers: a linguistic feature bias favoring LLM-generated writing styles, and an aversion toward critical statements. These results highlight the risks and equity concerns posed to human authors and academic research if LLMs are deployed in the peer review cycle without adequate caution. On the other hand, revisions guided by LLM reviews yield quality gains in both LLM-based and human evaluations, illustrating the potential of the LLMs-as-reviewers for early-stage researchers and enhancing low-quality papers.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a fine-grained input attribution method to identify the specific words most important for brain-LLM alignment, and leverage it to study a contentious research question about brain-LLM alignment: the relationship between brain alignment (BA) and next-word prediction (NWP). Our findings reveal that BA and NWP rely on largely distinct word subsets: NWP exhibits recency and primacy biases with a focus on syntax, while BA prioritizes semantic and discourse-level information with a more targeted recency effect. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs relate to human language processing and highlights differences in feature reliance between BA and NWP. Beyond this study, our attribution method can be broadly applied to explore the cognitive relevance of model predictions in diverse language processing tasks.</p></details> |  |

The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right" subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional mathematicians.</p></details> |  |

We address this challenge by presenting a scalable, unsupervised pipeline for automating grammatical annotation in voluminous corpora using large language models (LLMs). Unlike previous supervised and iterative approaches, our method employs a four-phase workflow: prompt engineering, pre-hoc evaluation, automated batch processing, and post-hoc validation. We demonstrate the pipeline's accessibility and effectiveness through a diachronic case study of variation in the English consider construction. Using GPT-5 through the OpenAI API, we annotate 143,933 sentences from the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA) in under 60 hours, achieving 98%+ accuracy on two sophisticated annotation procedures. Our results suggest that LLMs can perform a range of data preparation tasks at scale with minimal human intervention, opening new possibilities for corpus-based research, though implementation requires attention to costs, licensing, and other ethical considerations.</p></details> |  |

A Scoping Review on Verbalization in Software Engineering with LLM-Assisted Screening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12294v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how software developers think, make decisions, and behave remains a key challenge in software engineering (SE). Verbalization techniques (methods that capture spoken or written thought processes) offer a lightweight and accessible way to study these cognitive aspects. This paper presents a scoping review of research at the intersection of SE and psychology (PSY), focusing on the use of verbal data. To make large-scale interdisciplinary reviews feasible, we employed a large language model (LLM)-assisted screening pipeline using GPT to assess the relevance of over 9,000 papers based solely on titles. We addressed two questions: what themes emerge from verbalization-related work in SE, and how effective are LLMs in supporting interdisciplinary review processes? We validated GPT's outputs against human reviewers and found high consistency, with a 13\% disagreement rate. Prominent themes mainly were tied to the craft of SE, while more human-centered topics were underrepresented. The data also suggests that SE frequently draws on PSY methods, whereas the reverse is rare.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint of a paper under publication in Quality of Information and Communications Technology 2025</p></details> |

A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100 pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair, we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed. Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as evaluators in both research and deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages, 5 Tables, 1 Figures</p></details> |

Yet, a central question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful} to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First, correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure faithfulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 Pag...</summary><p>5 Pages, 4 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |

Existing evaluation frameworks typically assess single-turn question answering under idealized conditions, overlooking the complexities of medical consultations where conflicting input, misleading context, and authority influence are common. We introduce MedQA-Followup, a framework for systematically evaluating multi-turn robustness in medical question answering. Our approach distinguishes between shallow robustness (resisting misleading initial context) and deep robustness (maintaining accuracy when answers are challenged across turns), while also introducing an indirect-direct axis that separates contextual framing (indirect) from explicit suggestion (direct). Using controlled interventions on the MedQA dataset, we evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs and find that while models perform reasonably well under shallow perturbations, they exhibit severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn settings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2% to as low as 13.5% for Claude Sonnet 4. Counterintuitively, indirect, context-based interventions are often more harmful than direct suggestions, yielding larger accuracy drops across models and exposing a significant vulnerability for clinical deployment. Further compounding analyses reveal model differences, with some showing additional performance drops under repeated interventions while others partially recovering or even improving. These findings highlight multi-turn robustness as a critical but underexplored dimension for safe and reliable deployment of medical LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset and code: https://huggingface.co/datasets/dynamoai-ml/MedQA-USMLE-4-MultiTurnRobust ; https://github.com/bmanczak/MedQA-MultiTurnRobustness Accepted as a poster at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on GenAI for Health: Potential, Trust, and Policy Compliance</p></details> |
| **[Your Pre-trained LLM is Secretly an Unsupervised Confidence Calibrator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16690v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training of large language models is essential for adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to align with human preferences and downstream tasks. While PLMs typically exhibit well-calibrated confidence, post-trained language models (PoLMs) often suffer from over-confidence, assigning high confidence to both correct and incorrect outputs, which can undermine reliability in critical applications. A major obstacle in calibrating PoLMs is the scarcity of labeled data for individual downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Disagreement-Aware Confidence Alignment (DACA), a novel unsupervised method to optimize the parameters (e.g., temperature $\tau$) in post-hoc confidence calibration. Our method is motivated by the under-confidence issue caused by prediction disagreement between the PLM and PoLM while aligning their confidence via temperature scaling. Theoretically, the PLM's confidence underestimates PoLM's prediction accuracy on disagreement examples, causing a larger $\tau$ and producing under-confident predictions. DACA mitigates this by selectively using only agreement examples for calibration, effectively decoupling the influence of disagreement. In this manner, our method avoids an overly large $\tau$ in temperature scaling caused by disagreement examples, improving calibration performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, improving the average ECE of open-sourced and API-based LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o) by up to 15.08$\%$ on common benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Most existing multi-modal alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA) that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM, allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for quantum property prediction. The code is available at https://github.com/jk-sounds/MoRA.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigated whether the well-known Knobe effect, a moral bias in intentionality judgements, emerges in finetuned LLMs and whether it can be traced back to specific components of the model. We conducted a Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs and demonstrated that the bias is not only learned during finetuning but also localized in a specific set of layers. Surprisingly, we found that patching activations from the corresponding pretrained model into just a few critical layers is sufficient to eliminate the effect. Our findings offer new evidence that social biases in LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted interventions, without the need for model retraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2) an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness, and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained, task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual support and domain-specific applicability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing evaluations lack grounding in real-world scenarios and do not account for differences in harm severity, e.g., a biased decision in surgery should not be weighed the same as a stylistic bias in text summarization. To address this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a deployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications and weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline. Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision support but worse in education. We conclude that HALF exposes a clear gap between previous benchmarking success and deployment readiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaptJobRec: Enhancing Conversational Career Recommendation through an LLM-Powered Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13423v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, recommendation systems have evolved from providing a single list of recommendations to offering a comprehensive suite of topic focused services. To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems (CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic systems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However, agentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge for conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between handling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the first conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent to integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a user query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency. For straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool for rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing module to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to the intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks using personalized recommendation tools. Evaluation on Walmart's real world career recommendation scenarios demonstrates that AdaptJobRec reduces average response latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while significantly improving recommendation accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[ICL-Router: In-Context Learned Model Representations for LLM Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09719v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without retraining the router. The code is available at https://github.com/lalalamdbf/ICL-Router.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[When "Competency" in Reasoning Opens the Door to Vulnerability: Jailbreaking LLMs via Novel Complex Ciphers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10601v5)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) safety have primarily focused on mitigating attacks crafted in natural language or common ciphers (e.g. Base64), which are likely integrated into newer models' safety training. However, we reveal a paradoxical vulnerability: as LLMs advance in reasoning, they inadvertently become more susceptible to novel jailbreaking attacks. Enhanced reasoning enables LLMs to interpret complex instructions and decode complex user-defined ciphers, creating an exploitable security gap. To study this vulnerability, we introduce Attacks using Custom Encryptions (ACE), a jailbreaking technique that encodes malicious queries with novel ciphers. Extending ACE, we introduce Layered Attacks using Custom Encryptions (LACE), which applies multi-layer ciphers to amplify attack complexity. Furthermore, we develop CipherBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' accuracy in decoding encrypted benign text. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off: LLMs that are more capable of decoding ciphers are more vulnerable to LACE, with success rates on gpt-oss-20b escalating from 60% under ACE to 72% with LACE. These findings highlight a critical insight: as LLMs become more adept at deciphering complex user ciphers--many of which cannot be preemptively included in safety training--they become increasingly exploitable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Reliable ML from Unreliable Data workshop @ NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Stronger Together: On-Policy Reinforcement Learning for Collaborative LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11062v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MAS) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used to enhance the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). MAS improves task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However, applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and multi-policy models. We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single- and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks, AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5 percent. It also improves reasoning performance, with average gains of 3.87 to 7.62 percent on coding tasks and 9.0 to 17.93 percent on math.

| **[Attention-Aware GNN-based Input Defense against Multi-Turn LLM Jailbreak](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07146v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in various applications, yet their capabilities present risks for both constructive and malicious exploitation. Despite extensive training and fine-tuning efforts aimed at enhancing safety, LLMs remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Recently, the emergence of multi-turn attacks has intensified this vulnerability. Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks incrementally escalate dialogue complexity, rendering them more challenging to detect and mitigate. In this study, we introduce G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based input classifier specifically designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks targeting LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, which captures the interrelationships between queries and harmful keywords that present in multi-turn queries. Furthermore, we propose an attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most relevant single-turn query based on the ongoing multi-turn conversation. The retrieved query is incorporated as a labeled node within the graph, thereby enhancing the GNN's capacity to classify the current query as harmful or benign. Evaluation results show that G-Guard consistently outperforms all baselines across diverse datasets and evaluation metrics, demonstrating its efficacy as a robust defense mechanism against multi-turn jailbreak attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Engineering Multi-Agent LLMs: A Protocol-Driven Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12120v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for software development has driven interest in automating software engineering (SE) tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent efforts extend LLMs into multi-agent systems (MAS) that emulate collaborative development workflows, but these systems often fail due to three core deficiencies: under-specification, coordination misalignment, and inappropriate verification, arising from the absence of foundational SE structuring principles. This paper introduces Software Engineering Multi-Agent Protocol (SEMAP), a protocol-layer methodology that instantiates three core SE design principles for multi-agent LLMs: (1) explicit behavioral contract modeling, (2) structured messaging, and (3) lifecycle-guided execution with verification, and is implemented atop Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) infrastructure. Empirical evaluation using the Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy (MAST) framework demonstrates that SEMAP effectively reduces failures across different SE tasks. In code development, it achieves up to a 69.6% reduction in total failures for function-level development and 56.7% for deployment-level development. For vulnerability detection, SEMAP reduces failure counts by up to 47.4% on Python tasks and 28.2% on C/C++ tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Reconcile Knowledge Conflicts in Counterfactual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15732v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have been shown to contain extensive world knowledge in their parameters, enabling impressive performance on many knowledge intensive tasks. However, when deployed in novel settings, LLMs often encounter situations where they must integrate parametric knowledge with new or unfamiliar information. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can combine knowledge in-context with their parametric knowledge through the lens of counterfactual reasoning. Through synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop reasoning problems, we show that LLMs generally struggle with counterfactual reasoning, often resorting to exclusively using their parametric knowledge. Moreover, we show that simple post-hoc finetuning can struggle to instill counterfactual reasoning ability -- often leading to degradation in stored parametric knowledge. Ultimately, our work reveals important limitations of current LLM's abilities to re-purpose parametric knowledge in novel settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Workshop on Scaling up Intervention Models</p></details> |

This shift is largely pragmatic: conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO, achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Comprising 27,816 indoor layouts across 18 prevalent room types and a library of 29,215 high-fidelity 3D object assets, IL3D is enriched with instance-level natural language annotations to support robust multimodal learning for vision-language tasks. We establish rigorous benchmarks to evaluate LLM-driven scene generation. Experimental results show that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs on IL3D significantly improves generalization and surpasses the performance of SFT on other datasets. IL3D offers flexible multimodal data export capabilities, including point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, multiview images, depth maps, normal maps, and semantic masks, enabling seamless adaptation to various visual tasks.

| **[FedLoDrop: Federated LoRA with Dropout for Generalized LLM Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12078v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning (FT) large language models (LLMs) is crucial for adapting general-purpose models to specific tasks, enhancing accuracy and relevance with minimal resources. To further enhance generalization ability while reducing training costs, this paper proposes Federated LoRA with Dropout (FedLoDrop), a new framework that applies dropout to the rows and columns of the trainable matrix in Federated LoRA. A generalization error bound and convergence analysis under sparsity regularization are obtained, which elucidate the fundamental trade-off between underfitting and overfitting. The error bound reveals that a higher dropout rate increases model sparsity, thereby lowering the upper bound of pointwise hypothesis stability (PHS). While this reduces the gap between empirical and generalization errors, it also incurs a higher empirical error, which, together with the gap, determines the overall generalization error. On the other hand, though dropout reduces communication costs, deploying FedLoDrop at the network edge still faces challenges due to limited network resources. To address this issue, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the upper bound of the generalization error, by jointly optimizing the dropout rate and resource allocation subject to the latency and per-device energy consumption constraints. To solve this problem, a branch-and-bound (B\&B)-based method is proposed to obtain its globally optimal solution. Moreover, to reduce the high computational complexity of the B\&B-based method, a penalized successive convex approximation (P-SCA)-based algorithm is proposed to efficiently obtain its high-quality suboptimal solution. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating overfitting and improving the generalization capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvolveNav: Empowering LLM-Based Vision-Language Navigation via Self-Improving Embodied Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01551v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have revealed the potential of training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning ability for enhancing vision-language navigation (VLN) performance, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches predominantly adopt straightforward input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose EvolveNav, a novel sElf-improving embodied reasoning paradigm that realizes adaptable and generalizable navigational reasoning for boosting LLM-based vision-language Navigation. Specifically, EvolveNav involves a two-stage training process: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model with curated formalized CoT labels to first activate the model's navigational reasoning capabilities, and simultaneously increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A self-reflective auxiliary task is also designed to encourage the model to learn correct reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results under both task-specific and cross-task training paradigms demonstrate the consistent superiority of EvolveNav over previous LLM-based VLN approaches on various popular benchmarks, including R2R, REVERIE, CVDN, and SOON. Code is available at https://github.com/expectorlin/EvolveNav.</p></details> |  |

An enhanced pipeline parallelism scheme is implemented within the Ascend full-stack environment of Huawei, which effectively eliminates the impact of cross-DC communication overhead on training efficiency. The overlapped computation and cross-DC communication is achieved with constraint cross-DC bandwidth and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), reducing computation bubble ratio by up to 78.91%.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models (LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL) that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure, demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases, assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines. The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and hurricanes.</p></details> |  |

The field now faces a critical dilemma in its approach: closed-source models like GPT-4 deliver state-of-the-art performance but restrict reproducibility, accessibility, and external oversight, while open-source frameworks like LLaMA and Mixtral democratize access, foster collaboration, and support diverse applications, achieving competitive results through techniques like instruction tuning and LoRA. Hybrid approaches address challenges like bias mitigation and resource accessibility by combining the scalability of closed-source systems with the transparency and inclusivity of open-source framework. However, in this position paper, we argue that open-source remains the most robust path for advancing LLM research and ethical deployment.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Can LLMs Reason Structurally? An Evaluation via the Lens of Data Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24069v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) take on increasingly complex tasks, understanding their algorithmic reasoning abilities has become essential. However, existing evaluations focus on distinct and isolated tasks. We propose a unified diagnostic lens: structural reasoning--understanding and manipulating relationships like order, hierarchy, and connectivity. We introduce DSR-Bench, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate LLM structural reasoning through canonical data structures, which serve as interpretable, algorithmically meaningful abstractions. DSR-Bench spans 20 data structures, 35 operations, and 4,140 synthetically generated problem instances with minimal contamination. The benchmark's hierarchical design pinpoints specific failure modes, while its fully automated evaluation ensures objective and consistent assessment. Benchmarking ten state-of-the-art LLMs reveals critical limitations: the top-performing model scores only 0.498 out of 1 on challenging instances. Three additional evaluation suites reveal further weaknesses: models perform poorly on spatial data and natural language scenarios, and fail to reason over their own generated code. DSR-Bench offers a principled diagnostic tool for structural reasoning, helping expose reasoning bottlenecks and guide the development of more capable and reliable LLMs.</p></details> |  |

This paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS) and an LLM-based IE system in the agricultural domain, evaluating them on nine interviews across pork, dairy, and crop subdomains. The LLM-based system outperforms the NS one (F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2), where total includes all extracted information and core focuses on essential details. However, each system has trade-offs: the NS approach offers faster runtime, greater control, and high accuracy in context-free tasks but lacks generalizability, struggles with contextual nuances, and requires significant resources to develop and maintain. The LLM-based system achieves higher performance, faster deployment, and easier maintenance but has slower runtime, limited control, model dependency and hallucination risks. Our findings highlight the "hidden cost" of deploying NLP systems in real-world applications, emphasizing the need to balance performance, efficiency, and control.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

While recent methods have shown promise, existing evaluations are limited in both model scale and task diversity, leaving open questions about their applicability to large, domain-specialized LLMs. To tackle the challenges, we introduce MergeBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess model merging at scale. MergeBench builds on state-of-the-art open-source language models, including Llama and Gemma families at 2B to 9B scales, and covers five key domains: instruction following, mathematics, multilingual understanding, coding and safety. We standardize finetuning and evaluation protocols, and assess eight representative merging methods across multi-task performance, forgetting and runtime efficiency. Based on extensive experiments, we provide practical guidelines for algorithm selection and share insights showing that model merging tends to perform better on stronger base models, with techniques such as merging coefficient tuning and sparsification improving knowledge retention. However, several challenges remain, including the computational cost on large models, the gap for in-domain performance compared to multi-task models, and the underexplored role of model merging in standard LLM training pipelines. We hope MergeBench provides a foundation for future research to advance the understanding and practical application of model merging.

| **[Phaedrus: Predicting Dynamic Application Behavior with Lightweight Generative Models and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06994v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application profiling is an indispensable technique for many software development tasks, such as code and memory layout optimizations, where optimization decisions are tailored to specific program profiles. Unfortunately, modern application codebases exhibit highly variant behavior across different inputs, creating challenges for conventional profiling approaches that rely on a single representative execution instance. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Phaedrus}, a new \textit{compiler-assisted deep learning framework} designed to predict dynamic program behaviors across varied execution instances, specifically focusing on dynamic function call prediction.Such predicted call sequences are then used for producing optimized code pertinent to a given input. Traditional profile-guided optimization methods struggle with the input-dependent variability of modern applications, where profiling on different inputs yields divergent application behaviors. To address this, Phaedrus proposes two new approaches: \textit{Application Behavior Synthesis}, a profile-less approach where Large Language Models (LLMs) directly infer dynamic functions based on source code \& static compiler analysis, bypassing the need for traditional profiling, and \textit{Application Profile Generalization}, which uses generative models trained on compressed and augmented \textit{Whole Program Path} (WPP) based function profiles to predict application behavior under unseen inputs. Our experiments show that \textit{Phaedrus} can achieve upto $10^7X$ reduction in WPP function profile sizes, can predict most frequently executed functions that cover upto 85-99\% of the execution time, along with an average of 13.19\% (upto 65\%) reduction in application binary size, and an average of 6.08\% (upto 20\%) performance improvement over the traditional profile-guided optimization, without any execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning on a Spectrum: Aligning LLMs to System 1 and System 2 Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12470v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning abilities, yet their reliance on structured step-by-step processing reveals a critical limitation. In contrast, human cognition fluidly adapts between intuitive, heuristic (System 1) and analytical, deliberative (System 2) reasoning depending on the context. This difference between human cognitive flexibility and LLMs' reliance on a single reasoning style raises a critical question: while human fast heuristic reasoning evolved for its efficiency and adaptability, is a uniform reasoning approach truly optimal for LLMs, or does its inflexibility make them brittle and unreliable when faced with tasks demanding more agile, intuitive responses? To answer these questions, we explicitly align LLMs to these reasoning styles by curating a dataset with valid System 1 and System 2 answers, and evaluate their performance across reasoning benchmarks. Our results reveal an accuracy-efficiency trade-off: System 2-aligned models excel in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning, while System 1-aligned models perform better in commonsense reasoning tasks. To analyze the reasoning spectrum, we interpolated between the two extremes by varying the proportion of alignment data, which resulted in a monotonic change in accuracy. A mechanistic analysis of model responses shows that System 1 models employ more definitive outputs, whereas System 2 models demonstrate greater uncertainty. Building on these findings, we further combine System 1- and System 2-aligned models based on the entropy of their generations, without additional training, and obtain a dynamic model that outperforms across nearly all benchmarks. This work challenges the assumption that step-by-step reasoning is always optimal and highlights the need for adapting reasoning strategies based on task demands.</p></details> |  |

Our approach introduces an AST-based augmentation technique inspired by mutation testing, a structure-aware attention mechanism that incorporates augmented AST features, and a joint adaptation pipeline to unify code semantics and syntax. Experimental results on three large-scale datasets, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and PrimeVul-demonstrate state-of-the-art performance while enabling rapid inference on CPUs with minimal training time.

| **[CTIArena: Benchmarking LLM Knowledge and Reasoning Across Heterogeneous Cyber Threat Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11974v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is central to modern cybersecurity, providing critical insights for detecting and mitigating evolving threats. With the natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in applying them to CTI, which calls for benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate their performance. Several early efforts have studied LLMs on some CTI tasks but remain limited: (i) they adopt only closed-book settings, relying on parametric knowledge without leveraging CTI knowledge bases; (ii) they cover only a narrow set of tasks, lacking a systematic view of the CTI landscape; and (iii) they restrict evaluation to single-source analysis, unlike realistic scenarios that require reasoning across multiple sources. To fill these gaps, we present CTIArena, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on heterogeneous, multi-source CTI under knowledge-augmented settings. CTIArena spans three categories, structured, unstructured, and hybrid, further divided into nine tasks that capture the breadth of CTI analysis in modern security operations. We evaluate ten widely used LLMs and find that most struggle in closed-book setups but show noticeable gains when augmented with security-specific knowledge through our designed retrieval-augmented techniques. These findings highlight the limitations of general-purpose LLMs and the need for domain-tailored techniques to fully unlock their potential for CTI.</p></details> | Under peer-review |

We introduce Context-Folding, a framework that empowers agents to actively manage their working context. An agent can procedurally branch into a sub-trajectory to handle a subtask and then fold it upon completion, collapsing the intermediate steps while retaining a concise summary of the outcome. To make this behavior learnable, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework FoldGRPO with specific process rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. On complex long-horizon tasks (Deep Research and SWE), our folding agent matches or outperforms the ReAct baselines while using an active context 10$\times$ smaller and significantly outperforms models that rely on summarization-based context management.</p></details> |  |

Introducing CulturalPersonas for Evaluating Trait Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05670v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLMs become central to interactive applications, ranging from tutoring to mental health, the ability to express personality in culturally appropriate ways is increasingly important. While recent works have explored personality evaluation of LLMs, they largely overlook the interplay between culture and personality. To address this, we introduce CulturalPersonas, the first large-scale benchmark with human validation for evaluating LLMs' personality expression in culturally grounded, behaviorally rich contexts. Our dataset spans 3,000 scenario-based questions across six diverse countries, designed to elicit personality through everyday scenarios rooted in local values. We evaluate three LLMs, using both multiple-choice and open-ended response formats. Our results show that CulturalPersonas improves alignment with country-specific human personality distributions (over a 20% reduction in Wasserstein distance across models and countries) and elicits more expressive, culturally coherent outputs compared to existing benchmarks. CulturalPersonas surfaces meaningful modulated trait outputs in response to culturally grounded prompts, offering new directions for aligning LLMs to global norms of behavior. By bridging personality expression and cultural nuance, we envision that CulturalPersonas will pave the way for more socially intelligent and globally adaptive LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Current systems rely on static pipeline configurations that struggle to adapt to dynamic workload conditions, leading to substantial inefficiencies. We present FlexPipe, a novel system that dynamically reconfigures pipeline architectures during runtime to address these fundamental limitations. FlexPipe decomposes models into fine-grained stages and intelligently adjusts pipeline granularity based on real-time request pattern analysis, implementing three key innovations: fine-grained model partitioning with preserved computational graph constraints, inflight pipeline refactoring with consistent cache transitions, and topology-aware resource allocation that navigates GPU fragmentation. Comprehensive evaluation on an 82-GPU cluster demonstrates that FlexPipe achieves up to 8.5x better resource efficiency while maintaining 38.3% lower latency compared to state-of-the-art systems, reducing GPU reservation requirements from 75% to 30% of peak capacity.</p></details> | EuroSys 26 |
| **[Robust ML-based Detection of Conventional, LLM-Generated, and Adversarial Phishing Emails Using Advanced Text Preprocessing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11915v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phishing remains a critical cybersecurity threat, especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs) capable of generating highly convincing malicious content. Unlike earlier phishing attempts which are identifiable by grammatical errors, misspellings, incorrect phrasing, and inconsistent formatting, LLM generated emails are grammatically sound, contextually relevant, and linguistically natural. These advancements make phishing emails increasingly difficult to distinguish from legitimate ones, challenging traditional detection mechanisms. Conventional phishing detection systems often fail when faced with emails crafted by LLMs or manipulated using adversarial perturbation techniques. To address this challenge, we propose a robust phishing email detection system featuring an enhanced text preprocessing pipeline. This pipeline includes spelling correction and word splitting to counteract adversarial modifications and improve detection accuracy. Our approach integrates widely adopted natural language processing (NLP) feature extraction techniques and machine learning algorithms. We evaluate our models on publicly available datasets comprising both phishing and legitimate emails, achieving a detection accuracy of 94.26% and F1-score of 84.39% in model deployment setting. To assess robustness, we further evaluate our models using adversarial phishing samples generated by four attack methods in Python TextAttack framework. Additionally, we evaluate models' performance against phishing emails generated by LLMs including ChatGPT and Llama. Results highlight the resilience of models against evolving AI-powered phishing threats.</p></details> |  |

Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM performance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to trivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is a direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this question, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode statement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily separated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of learned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that have undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution (OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving perturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more OOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge probing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement truthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to those seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true and false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this ability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These findings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs may learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only limited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the utility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChatThero: An LLM-Supported Chatbot for Behavior Change and Therapeutic Support in Addiction Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20996v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect millions of people, and relapses are common, requiring multi-session treatments. Access to care is limited, which contributes to the challenge of recovery support. We present \textbf{ChatThero}, an innovative low-cost, multi-session, stressor-aware, and memory-persistent autonomous \emph{language agent} designed to facilitate long-term behavior change and therapeutic support in addiction recovery. Unlike existing work that mostly finetuned large language models (LLMs) on patient-therapist conversation data, ChatThero was trained in a multi-agent simulated environment that mirrors real therapy. We created anonymized patient profiles from recovery communities (e.g., Reddit). We classify patients as \texttt{easy}, \texttt{medium}, and \texttt{difficult}, three scales representing their resistance to recovery. We created an external environment by introducing stressors (e.g., social determinants of health) to simulate real-world situations. We dynamically inject clinically-grounded therapeutic strategies (motivational interview and cognitive behavioral therapy). Our evaluation, conducted by both human (blinded clinicians) and LLM-as-Judge, shows that ChatThero is superior in empathy and clinical relevance. We show that stressor simulation improves robustness of ChatThero. Explicit stressors increase relapse-like setbacks, matching real-world patterns. We evaluate ChatThero with behavioral change metrics. On a 1--5 scale, ChatThero raises \texttt{motivation} by $+1.71$ points (from $2.39$ to $4.10$) and \texttt{confidence} by $+1.67$ points (from $1.52$ to $3.19$), substantially outperforming GPT-5. On \texttt{difficult} patients, ChatThero reaches the success milestone with $26\%$ fewer turns than GPT-5.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Consensus: Mitigating the Agreeableness Bias in LLM Judge Evaluations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11822v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw: LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often leads to inflated reliability scores. While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366 high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Aware Reduction for Scalable LLM-Database Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11813v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to data-intensive workflows, from database querying to developer observability. Yet the effectiveness of these systems is constrained by the volume, verbosity, and noise of real-world text-rich data such as logs, telemetry, and monitoring streams. Feeding such data directly into LLMs is costly, environmentally unsustainable, and often misaligned with task objectives. Parallel efforts in LLM efficiency have focused on model- or architecture-level optimizations, but the challenge of reducing upstream input verbosity remains underexplored. In this paper, we argue for treating the token budget of an LLM as an attention budget and elevating task-aware text reduction as a first-class design principle for language -- data systems. We position input-side reduction not as compression, but as attention allocation: prioritizing information most relevant to downstream tasks. We outline open research challenges for building benchmarks, designing adaptive reduction pipelines, and integrating token-budget--aware preprocessing into database and retrieval systems. Our vision is to channel scarce attention resources toward meaningful signals in noisy, data-intensive workflows, enabling scalable, accurate, and sustainable LLM--data integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[QeRL: Beyond Efficiency -- Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11696v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4 quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism, which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/NVlabs/QeRL</p></details> |
| **[When Agents Trade: Live Multi-Market Trading Benchmark for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11695v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used in financial trading, it remains unclear whether they can reason and adapt in live markets, as most studies test models instead of agents, cover limited periods and assets, and rely on unverified data. To address these gaps, we introduce Agent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures within a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison under real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a single-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk styles, and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them across GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.0-flash. Live experiments on both cryptocurrency and stock markets demonstrate that agent frameworks display markedly distinct behavioral patterns, spanning from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making, whereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation. AMA thus establishes a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving evaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Let's Reason Formally: Natural-Formal Hybrid Reasoning Enhances LLM's Math Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23703v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However, RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning (NFL-HR)**, an end-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the NL-FL Problem Alignment method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the Mixed Problem Input technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in reasoning through an LLM-based Answer Extraction mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the NFL-HR framework achieves **89.80**% and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by **4.60%** and **4.82%**, respectively. Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL baseline model even under a larger number of trials.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Oriented Token-Adaptive Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11615v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large-scale language models (LLMs), yet prevailing logit-based methods typically employ static strategies that are misaligned with the dynamic learning process of student models. These methods typically treat all tokens indiscriminately and apply a single, fixed temperature, resulting in suboptimal knowledge transfer. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-Oriented Token-Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AdaKD), a novel framework that adapts the distillation process to the real-time learning state of each token. AdaKD consists of two synergistic modules driven by a unified token difficulty metric. First, our Loss-Driven Adaptive Token Focusing (LATF) module dynamically adjusts the distillation focus by monitoring the student's learning stability, concentrating computational resources on the most valuable tokens at each training phase. Second, we introduce Inverse Difficulty Temperature Scaling (IDTS), a counterintuitive yet effective token-level temperature strategy. It employs low temperatures for difficult tokens for targeted error correction, and high temperatures for easy tokens to encourage students to learn from the teacher's complete and smooth output distribution, thereby enhancing generalization. As a plug-and-play framework, AdaKD can consistently improve the performance of various distillation methods on multiple model architectures and benchmarks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

As requirements grow, these documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT data.</p></details> | 42 pages |

In this work, we introduce the first framework and benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic, multicultural conversational settings. Grounded in sociocultural theory, our framework formalizes how linguistic style - a key element of cultural communication - is shaped by situational, relational, and cultural context. We construct a benchmark dataset based on this framework, annotated by culturally diverse raters, and propose a new set of desiderata for cross-cultural evaluation in NLP: conversational framing, stylistic sensitivity, and subjective correctness. We evaluate today's top LLMs on our benchmark and show that these models struggle with cultural adaptation in a conversational setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the 4th HCI + NLP Workshop @ EMNLP</p></details> |

However, existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for multi-turn negotiation.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).</p></details> |  |

Since the recent emergence of AI enterprise AI assistants enhancing business productivity, safeguarding private data and compliance is now a priority. With the implementation of AI assistants across the enterprise, the zero data retention can be achieved by implementing zero data retention policies by Large Language Model businesses like Open AI and Anthropic and Meta. In this work, we explore zero data retention policies for the Enterprise apps of large language models (LLMs). Our key contribution is defining the architectural, compliance, and usability trade-offs of such systems in parallel. In this research work, we examine the development of commercial AI assistants with two industry leaders and market titans in this arena - Salesforce and Microsoft. Both of these companies used distinct technical architecture to support zero data retention policies. Salesforce AgentForce and Microsoft Copilot are among the leading AI assistants providing much-needed push to business productivity in customer care. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the technical architecture and deployment of zero data retention policy by consuming applications as well as big language models service providers like Open Ai, Anthropic, and Meta.</p></details> |  |

We propose a critical framework connecting empirical measurements of language vitality (real world demographic strength) and digitality (online presence) with postcolonial theory and epistemic injustice to explain why linguistic inequality in AI systems is not incidental but structural. Analyzing data across all documented human languages, we identify four categories: Strongholds (33%, high vitality and digitality), Digital Echoes (6%, high digitality despite declining vitality), Fading Voices (36%, low on both dimensions), and critically, Invisible Giants (27%, high vitality but near-zero digitality) - languages spoken by millions yet absent from the LLM universe. We demonstrate that these patterns reflect continuities from colonial-era linguistic hierarchies to contemporary AI development, constituting what we term digital epistemic injustice. Our analysis reveals that English dominance in AI is not a technical necessity but an artifact of power structures that systematically exclude marginalized linguistic knowledge. We conclude with implications for decolonizing language technology and democratizing access to AI benefits.</p></details> |  |

One fundamental aspect of effective learning is relevant, immediate, and constructive feedback to students. Providing constructive feedback to large cohorts in academia is an ongoing challenge. Therefore, academics are moving towards automated assessment to provide immediate feedback. However, current approaches are often limited in scope, offering simplistic responses that do not provide students with personalized feedback to guide them toward improvements. This paper addresses this limitation by investigating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing students assessments with predefined rubrics and marking criteria to generate personalized feedback for in-depth learning. We aim to leverage the power of existing LLMs for Marking Assessments, Tracking, and Evaluation (LLM-MATE) with personalized feedback to enhance students learning. To evaluate the performance of LLM-MATE, we consider the Software Architecture (SA) module as a case study. The LLM-MATE approach can help module leaders overcome assessment challenges with large cohorts. Also, it helps students improve their learning by obtaining personalized feedback in a timely manner. Additionally, the proposed approach will facilitate the establishment of ground truth for automating the generation of students assessment feedback using the ChatGPT API, thereby reducing the overhead associated with large cohort assessments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in LLMs Beyond the Base Model?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13837v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly on mathematics and programming tasks. Similar to how traditional RL helps agents explore and learn new strategies, RLVR is believed to enable LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities beyond those of the corresponding base models. In this study we critically examine the current state of RLVR by systematically probing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across various model families, RL algorithms, and math, coding, and visual reasoning benchmarks, using pass@k at large k values as the evaluation metric. Surprisingly, we find that the current training setup does not elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RLVR-trained models outperform their base models at small k (e.g., k = 1), the base models achieve a higher pass@k score when k is large. Coverage and perplexity analyses show that the observed reasoning abilities originate from and are bounded by the base model. Treating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that six popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in leveraging the potential of the base model. By contrast, we find that distillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and genuinely expand the model's reasoning capabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that current RLVR methods have not yet realized the potential of RL to elicit truly novel reasoning abilities in LLMs. This highlights the need for improved RL paradigms, such as continual scaling and multi-turn agent-environment interaction, to unlock this potential.</p></details> | 30 pages, 27 figures |

Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements. Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings.

We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool. During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable, vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference, we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle, keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains. Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference decoupling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating LLMs for Demographic-Targeted Social Bias Detection: A Comprehensive Benchmark Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04641v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale web-scraped text corpora used to train general-purpose AI models often contain harmful demographic-targeted social biases, creating a regulatory need for data auditing and developing scalable bias-detection methods. Although prior work has investigated biases in text datasets and related detection methods, these studies remain narrow in scope. They typically focus on a single content type (e.g., hate speech), cover limited demographic axes, overlook biases affecting multiple demographics simultaneously, and analyze limited techniques. Consequently, practitioners lack a holistic understanding of the strengths and limitations of recent large language models (LLMs) for automated bias detection. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework aimed at English texts to assess the ability of LLMs in detecting demographic-targeted social biases. To align with regulatory requirements, we frame bias detection as a multi-label task using a demographic-focused taxonomy. We then conduct a systematic evaluation with models across scales and techniques, including prompting, in-context learning, and fine-tuning. Using twelve datasets spanning diverse content types and demographics, our study demonstrates the promise of fine-tuned smaller models for scalable detection. However, our analyses also expose persistent gaps across demographic axes and multi-demographic targeted biases, underscoring the need for more effective and scalable auditing frameworks.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Continual training with long-context data becomes the de-facto method to equip LLMs with the ability to process long inputs. However, it still remains an open challenge to measure the quality of long-context training data. To address this issue, we propose a Long-context data selection framework with Attention-based Dependency Measurement (LADM), which can efficiently identify high-quality long-context data from a large-scale, multi-domain pre-training corpus. LADM leverages the retrieval capabilities of the attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies, ensuring a comprehensive quality measurement of long-context data. Experimental results show that our LADM framework significantly boosts the performance of LLMs on multiple long-context tasks with only 1B tokens for continual training.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025, our code is available at https://github.com/ZNLP/LADM</p></details> |
| **[From <Answer> to <Think>: Multidimensional Supervision of Reasoning Process for LLM Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11457v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions: Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain tasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles. Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the training distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolving LLMs' Self-Refinement Capability via Synergistic Training-Inference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05605v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-Refinement refers to a model's ability to revise its own responses to produce improved outputs. This capability can also serve as a fundamental mechanism for Self-Improvement, for example, by reconstructing datasets with refined results to enhance intrinsic model performance. However, our comprehensive experiments reveal that large language models (LLMs) show no clear evidence of inherent Self-Refinement and may even experience response quality degradation after Self-Refinement. To address this issue, we propose EVOLVE, a simple and effective framework for eliciting and tracking the evolution of Self-Refinement through iterative training. We first explore optimization methods during training to activate the model's Self-Refinement capability. Then, at inference, we investigate various generation strategies to further enhance and utilize Self-Refinement while supplying the necessary data for training. Through synergistic optimization of training and inference stages, we continually evolve the model's Self-Refinement ability, enabling it to better refine its own responses. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of leveraging Self-Refinement to achieve broader Self-Improvement of intrinsic model abilities. Experiments show that the evolved Self-Refinement ability enables the Llama-3.1-8B base model to surpass GPT-4o, achieving 62.3% length-controlled and 63.3% raw win rates on AlpacaEval 2, and 50.3% on Arena-Hard. It also generalizes effectively to out-of-domain reasoning tasks, improving performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH.</p></details> |  |

Personality and Demographic Style in LLM-Generated Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11434v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative large language models (LLMs) have become central to everyday life, producing human-like text across diverse domains. A growing body of research investigates whether these models also exhibit personality- and demographic-like characteristics in their language. In this work, we introduce a novel, data-driven methodology for assessing LLM personality without relying on self-report questionnaires, applying instead automatic personality and gender classifiers to model replies on open-ended questions collected from Reddit. Comparing six widely used models to human-authored responses, we find that LLMs systematically express higher Agreeableness and lower Neuroticism, reflecting cooperative and stable conversational tendencies. Gendered language patterns in model text broadly resemble those of human writers, though with reduced variation, echoing prior findings on automated agents. We contribute a new dataset of human and model responses, along with large-scale comparative analyses, shedding new light on the topic of personality and demographic patterns of generative AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECAI2...</summary><p>ECAI2025 (Identity-Aware AI workshop)</p></details> |

However, our analysis of 30.8K health-related notes reveals significant latency, with a median delay of 17.6 hours before the first note receives a helpfulness status. To improve responsiveness during real-world misinformation surges, we propose CrowdNotes+, a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment Community Notes for faster and more reliable health misinformation governance. CrowdNotes+ integrates two complementary modes: (1) evidence-grounded note augmentation and (2) utility-guided note automation, along with a hierarchical three-step evaluation that progressively assesses relevance, correctness, and helpfulness. We instantiate the framework through HealthNotes, a benchmark of 1.2K helpfulness-annotated health notes paired with a fine-tuned helpfulness judge. Experiments on fifteen LLMs reveal an overlooked loophole in current helpfulness evaluation, where stylistic fluency is mistaken for factual accuracy, and demonstrate that our hierarchical evaluation and LLM-augmented generation jointly enhance factual precision and evidence utility. These results point toward a hybrid human-AI governance model that improves both the rigor and timeliness of crowd-sourced fact-checking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware, Risk-Adaptive Access Control for Agentic Systems using an LLM-Judged TBAC Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11414v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of autonomous AI agents within enterprise environments introduces a critical security challenge: managing access control for emergent, novel tasks for which no predefined policies exist. This paper introduces an advanced security framework that extends the Task-Based Access Control (TBAC) model by using a Large Language Model (LLM) as an autonomous, risk-aware judge. This model makes access control decisions not only based on an agent's intent but also by explicitly considering the inherent \textbf{risk associated with target resources} and the LLM's own \textbf{model uncertainty} in its decision-making process. When an agent proposes a novel task, the LLM judge synthesizes a just-in-time policy while also computing a composite risk score for the task and an uncertainty estimate for its own reasoning. High-risk or high-uncertainty requests trigger more stringent controls, such as requiring human approval. This dual consideration of external risk and internal confidence allows the model to enforce a more robust and adaptive version of the principle of least privilege, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging LLMs for Semi-Automatic Corpus Filtration in Systematic Literature Reviews](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11409v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The creation of systematic literature reviews (SLR) is critical for analyzing the landscape of a research field and guiding future research directions. However, retrieving and filtering the literature corpus for an SLR is highly time-consuming and requires extensive manual effort, as keyword-based searches in digital libraries often return numerous irrelevant publications. In this work, we propose a pipeline leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs), classifying papers based on descriptive prompts and deciding jointly using a consensus scheme. The entire process is human-supervised and interactively controlled via our open-source visual analytics web interface, LLMSurver, which enables real-time inspection and modification of model outputs. We evaluate our approach using ground-truth data from a recent SLR comprising over 8,000 candidate papers, benchmarking both open and commercial state-of-the-art LLMs from mid-2024 and fall 2025. Results demonstrate that our pipeline significantly reduces manual effort while achieving lower error rates than single human annotators. Furthermore, modern open-source models prove sufficient for this task, making the method accessible and cost-effective. Overall, our work demonstrates how responsible human-AI collaboration can accelerate and enhance systematic literature reviews within academic workflows.</p></details> |  |

However, most studies reduce the game to LLM-based self-play, yielding templated utterances and anecdotal cases that overlook the richness of social gameplay. Evaluation further relies on coarse metrics such as survival time or subjective scoring due to the lack of quality reference data. To address these gaps, we curate a high-quality, human-verified multimodal Werewolf dataset containing over 100 hours of video, 32.4M utterance tokens, and 15 rule variants. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel strategy-alignment evaluation that leverages the winning faction's strategies as ground truth in two stages: 1) Speech evaluation, formulated as multiple-choice-style tasks that assess whether the model can adopt appropriate stances across five dimensions of social ability; and 2) Decision evaluation, which assesses the model's voting choices and opponent-role inferences. This framework enables a fine-grained evaluation of models' linguistic and reasoning capabilities, while capturing their ability to generate strategically coherent gameplay. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs show diverse performance, with roughly half remain below 0.50, revealing clear gaps in deception and counterfactual reasoning. We hope our dataset further inspires research on language, reasoning, and strategy in multi-agent interaction.</p></details> | 34 pages, 32figures |
| **[From $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ to $f(g(x))$: LLMs Learn New Skills in RL by Composing Old Ones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25123v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies. This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation. Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target, requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills, then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Specific Utility: A New Perspective for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11358v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. While traditional retrieval focuses on relevance, RAG's effectiveness depends on the utility of retrieved passages, i.e., the usefulness in facilitating the generation of an accurate and comprehensive answer. Existing studies often treat utility as a generic attribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from the same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension ability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion of LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple datasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal for LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across different LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the LLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some human-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific LLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for LLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings, we propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We evaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while verbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to assess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and to select truly useful ones for unknown queries.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Downgrade to Upgrade: Optimizer Simplification Enhances Robustness in LLM Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00761v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting. Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order (gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer, such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g., gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient LLM Inference over Heterogeneous Edge Networks with Speculative Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11331v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) inference at the network edge is a promising serving paradigm that leverages distributed edge resources to run inference near users and enhance privacy. Existing edge-based LLM inference systems typically adopt autoregressive decoding (AD), which only generates one token per forward pass. This iterative process, compounded by the limited computational resources of edge nodes, results in high serving latency and constrains the system's ability to support multiple users under growing demands.To address these challenges, we propose a speculative decoding (SD)-based LLM serving framework that deploys small and large models across heterogeneous edge nodes to collaboratively deliver inference services. Specifically, the small model rapidly generates draft tokens that the large model verifies in parallel, enabling multi-token generation per forward pass and thus reducing serving latency. To improve resource utilization of edge nodes, we incorporate pipeline parallelism to overlap drafting and verification across multiple inference tasks. Based on this framework, we analyze and derive a comprehensive latency model incorporating both communication and inference latency. Then, we formulate a joint optimization problem for speculation length, task batching, and wireless communication resource allocation to minimize total serving latency. To address this problem, we derive the closed-form solutions for wireless communication resource allocation, and develop a dynamic programming algorithm for joint batching and speculation control strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves lower serving latency compared to AD-based serving systems. In addition,the proposed joint optimization method delivers up to 44.9% latency reduction compared to benchmark schemes.</p></details> |  |

Emotion Circuits Discovery and Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11328v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the demand for emotional intelligence in large language models (LLMs) grows, a key challenge lies in understanding the internal mechanisms that give rise to emotional expression and in controlling emotions in generated text. This study addresses three core questions: (1) Do LLMs contain context-agnostic mechanisms shaping emotional expression? (2) What form do these mechanisms take? (3) Can they be harnessed for universal emotion control? We first construct a controlled dataset, SEV (Scenario-Event with Valence), to elicit comparable internal states across emotions. Subsequently, we extract context-agnostic emotion directions that reveal consistent, cross-context encoding of emotion (Q1). We identify neurons and attention heads that locally implement emotional computation through analytical decomposition and causal analysis, and validate their causal roles via ablation and enhancement interventions. Next, we quantify each sublayer's causal influence on the model's final emotion representation and integrate the identified local components into coherent global emotion circuits that drive emotional expression (Q2). Directly modulating these circuits achieves 99.65% emotion-expression accuracy on the test set, surpassing prompting- and steering-based methods (Q3). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study to uncover and validate emotion circuits in LLMs, offering new insights into interpretability and controllable emotional intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, 8 tables.

| **[Automated Skill Decomposition Meets Expert Ontologies: Bridging the Granularity Gap with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11313v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates automated skill decomposition using Large Language Models (LLMs) and proposes a rigorous, ontology-grounded evaluation framework. Our framework standardizes the pipeline from prompting and generation to normalization and alignment with ontology nodes. To evaluate outputs, we introduce two metrics: a semantic F1-score that uses optimal embedding-based matching to assess content accuracy, and a hierarchy-aware F1-score that credits structurally correct placements to assess granularity. We conduct experiments on ROME-ESCO-DecompSkill, a curated subset of parents, comparing two prompting strategies: zero-shot and leakage-safe few-shot with exemplars. Across diverse LLMs, zero-shot offers a strong baseline, while few-shot consistently stabilizes phrasing and granularity and improves hierarchy-aware alignment. A latency analysis further shows that exemplar-guided prompts are competitive - and sometimes faster - than unguided zero-shot due to more schema-compliant completions. Together, the framework, benchmark, and metrics provide a reproducible foundation for developing ontology-faithful skill decomposition systems.</p></details> |  |

While concerning, these findings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving out in-context learning (ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find that it does: across three datasets, three frontier models produce broadly misaligned responses at rates between 2% and 17% given 64 narrow in-context examples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. We also examine mechanisms of EM by eliciting step-by-step reasoning (while leaving in-context examples unchanged). Manual analysis of the resulting chain-of-thought shows that 67.5% of misaligned traces explicitly rationalize harmful outputs by adopting a reckless or dangerous ''persona'', echoing prior results on finetuning-induced EM.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they inherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based traffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as representing the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can be inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges, we propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a Vision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as image sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform cell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling numerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents floating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled with a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for predictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a memory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best baseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios. Our extensive experiments validate the model's strong generalization capabilities across various data-scarce environments.</p></details> |  |

The efficacy of these judges depends on their chain-of-thought reasoning, creating a critical need for methods that can effectively optimize this reasoning process. In this work, we introduce J1, a reinforcement learning framework for teaching LLM judges to think before making decisions. Our core contribution lies in converting all judgment tasks for non-verifiable and verifiable prompts into a unified format with verifiable rewards, enabling direct optimization of evaluation quality while mitigating positional bias. We then use RL to train thinking-judges at scales of 8B, 32B, and 70B and show that they obtain state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. In particular, J1-Qwen-32B, our multitasked pointwise and pairwise judge also outperforms o1-mini, o3, and a much larger 671B DeepSeek-R1 on some benchmarks, while only training on synthetic data. Through comprehensive ablations of pairwise, pointwise, and multitask J1 variants, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across seed prompts, reward strategies, and training recipes. Qualitative analysis reveals that J1 develops systematic evaluation strategies, including dynamic criteria generation, reference answer creation, iterative self-correction of initial assessments, and feedback generation for low-quality responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 13 tables, 14 figures</p></details> |

A key bottleneck is evaluating intermediate reasoning steps to guide generation without costly human annotations. To address this, we first introduce a novel Process Reward Model (PRM) trained automatically using Monte Carlo Tree Search coupled with a similarity-based data augmentation technique, effectively capturing step-level reasoning quality. Leveraging this PRM, we then adapt Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to operate at the reasoning step level. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning focused on maximizing a single reward, GFlowNets naturally sample diverse, high-quality solutions proportional to their rewards, as measured by our PRM. Empirical evaluation shows strong improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity on challenging mathematical benchmarks (e.g., +2.59% absolute accuracy on MATH Level 5 for Llama3.2-3B), with effective generalization to unseen datasets (+9.4\% absolute on SAT MATH). Furthermore, we benchmark our PRM against existing open-source reward models, demonstrating superior alignment with reasoning quality and more consistent guidance for downstream generation. Our work demonstrates the potential of PRM-guided, step-level GFlowNets for developing more robust and versatile mathematical reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models (LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex cryptography theorem.</p></details> |  |

At the macro level, a pooled $\epsilon$-machine is reconstructed as a reference model that summarizes the system-wide informational regime. At the micro level, $\epsilon$-machines are reconstructed for each caregiver-elder dyad and variable, and are complemented with algorithm-agnostic Kolmogorov-style measures, including normalized LZ78 complexity and bits per symbol from lossless compression. The resulting feature set $\{h_{\mu}, C_{\mu}, E, \mathrm{LZ78}, \mathrm{bps}\}$ enables distributional analysis, stratified comparisons, and unsupervised clustering across agents and scenarios. This dual-scale design preserves agent heterogeneity while providing an interpretable macro-level baseline, aligning ABM practice with CAS principles of emergence, feedback, and adaptation. A case study on caregiver-elder interactions illustrates the framework's implementation; the results and discussion will be completed following final simulation runs.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, methodological preprint</p></details> |

An important aspect of developing agents is their user experience (i.e., agent experience). There is a growing need to provide scaffolds for a broader set of individuals beyond AI engineers to prototype agent experiences, since they can contribute valuable perspectives to designing agent experiences. In this work, we explore the affordances agent prototyping systems should offer by conducting a requirements elicitation study with 12 participants with varying experience with agents. We identify key activities in agent experience prototyping and the desired capabilities of agent prototyping systems. We instantiate those capabilities in the AgentBuilder design probe for agent prototyping. We conduct an in situ agent prototyping study with 14 participants using AgentBuilder to validate the design requirements and elicit insights on how developers prototype agents and what their needs are in this process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Debate for LLM Judges with Adaptive Stability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12697v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[ERA: Transforming VLMs into Embodied Agents via Embodied Prior Learning and Online Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12693v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present \textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2) Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of 8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for future embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Informed Autonomous LLM Agents for Explainable Power Electronics Modulation Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14214v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based autonomous agents have recently shown strong capabilities in solving complex industrial design tasks. However, in domains aiming for carbon neutrality and high-performance renewable energy systems, current AI-assisted design automation methods face critical challenges in explainability, scalability, and practical usability. To address these limitations, we introduce PHIA (Physics-Informed Autonomous Agent), an LLM-driven system that automates modulation design for power converters in Power Electronics Systems with minimal human intervention. In contrast to traditional pipeline-based methods, PHIA incorporates an LLM-based planning module that interactively acquires and verifies design requirements via a user-friendly chat interface. This planner collaborates with physics-informed simulation and optimization components to autonomously generate and iteratively refine modulation designs. The interactive interface also supports interpretability by providing textual explanations and visual outputs throughout the design process. Experimental results show that PHIA reduces standard mean absolute error by 63.2% compared to the second-best benchmark and accelerates the overall design process by over 33 times. A user study involving 20 domain experts further confirms PHIA's superior design efficiency and usability, highlighting its potential to transform industrial design workflows in power electronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 Innovative Applications of AI</p></details> |
| **[Autonomous vehicles need social awareness to find optima in multi-agent reinforcement learning routing games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11410v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous work has shown that when multiple selfish Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are introduced to future cities and start learning optimal routing strategies using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), they may destabilize traffic systems, as they would require a significant amount of time to converge to the optimal solution, equivalent to years of real-world commuting. We demonstrate that moving beyond the selfish component in the reward significantly relieves this issue. If each AV, apart from minimizing its own travel time, aims to reduce its impact on the system, this will be beneficial not only for the system-wide performance but also for each individual player in this routing game. By introducing an intrinsic reward signal based on the marginal cost matrix, we significantly reduce training time and achieve convergence more reliably. Marginal cost quantifies the impact of each individual action (route-choice) on the system (total travel time). Including it as one of the components of the reward can reduce the degree of non-stationarity by aligning agents' objectives. Notably, the proposed counterfactual formulation preserves the system's equilibria and avoids oscillations. Our experiments show that training MARL algorithms with our novel reward formulation enables the agents to converge to the optimal solution, whereas the baseline algorithms fail to do so. We show these effects in both a toy network and the real-world network of Saint-Arnoult. Our results optimistically indicate that social awareness (i.e., including marginal costs in routing decisions) improves both the system-wide and individual performance of future urban systems with AVs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaMind: Modeling Human Social Thoughts with Metacognitive Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18943v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human social interactions depend on the ability to infer others' unspoken intentions, emotions, and beliefs-a cognitive skill grounded in the psychological concept of Theory of Mind (ToM). While large language models (LLMs) excel in semantic understanding tasks, they struggle with the ambiguity and contextual nuance inherent in human communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce MetaMind, a multi-agent framework inspired by psychological theories of metacognition, designed to emulate human-like social reasoning. MetaMind decomposes social understanding into three collaborative stages: (1) a Theory-of-Mind Agent generates hypotheses about user mental states (e.g., intent, emotion), (2) a Moral Agent refines these hypotheses using cultural norms and ethical constraints, and (3) a Response Agent generates contextually appropriate responses while validating alignment with inferred intent. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging benchmarks, with 35.7% improvement in real-world social scenarios and 6.2% gain in ToM reasoning. Notably, it enables LLMs to match human-level performance on key ToM tasks for the first time. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of all components, which showcase the framework's ability to balance contextual plausibility, social appropriateness, and user adaptation. This work advances AI systems toward human-like social intelligence, with applications in empathetic dialogue and culturally sensitive interactions.

| **[Memory as Action: Autonomous Context Curation for Long-Horizon Agentic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12635v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their constrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context. Existing working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic mechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we reframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We propose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages its working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a unified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement learning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under given resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the standard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions, leading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt the causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making those methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm, Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and applying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory management in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational consumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context curation strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEAR: Planner-Executor Agent Robustness Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07505v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex, multi-step tasks across diverse domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, MAS remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Existing studies typically examine isolated attack surfaces or specific scenarios, leaving a lack of holistic understanding of MAS vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of planner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our benchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and widely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak executor; (2) while a memory module is essential for the planner, having a memory module for the executor does not impact the clean task performance; (3) there exists a trade-off between task performance and robustness; and (4) attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the system. These findings offer actionable insights for enhancing the robustness of MAS and lay the groundwork for principled defenses in multi-agent settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inclusive Fitness as a Key Step Towards More Advanced Social Behaviors in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12555v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically advanced and socially intelligent agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version is a slightly updated version (e.g., added an important reference) compared to the peer-reviewed versions at 'Adapative Learning Agents' at AAMAS 2022 or 'From Cells to Societies' at ICLR 2022</p></details> |
| **[MooseAgent: A LLM Based Multi-agent Framework for Automating Moose Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08621v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used in engineering and scientific computing, but its pre-processing, solver configuration, and post-processing stages are often time-consuming and require specialized knowledge. This paper proposes an automated solution framework, MooseAgent, for the multi-physics simulation framework MOOSE, which combines large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs) with a multi-agent system. The framework uses LLMs to understand user-described simulation requirements in natural language and employs task decomposition and multi-round iterative verification strategies to automatically generate MOOSE input files. To improve accuracy and reduce model hallucinations, the system builds and utilizes a vector database containing annotated MOOSE input cards and function documentation. We conducted experimental evaluations on several typical cases, including heat transfer, mechanics, phase field, and multi-physics coupling. The results show that MooseAgent can automate the MOOSE simulation process to a certain extent, especially demonstrating a high success rate when dealing with relatively simple single-physics problems. The main contribution of this research is the proposal of a multi-agent automated framework for MOOSE, which validates its potential in simplifying finite element simulation processes and lowering the user barrier, providing new ideas for the development of intelligent finite element simulation software. The code for the MooseAgent framework proposed in this paper has been open-sourced and is available at https://github.com/taozhan18/MooseAgent</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 Figs |

Yet, open LLMs still perform poorly in such settings due to limited long-horizon reasoning capacity with browsing tools and the lack of sufficiently difficult supervised data. To address these challenges, we present DeepDive to advance deep search agents. First, we propose a strategy to automatically synthesize complex, difficult, and hard-to-find questions from open knowledge graphs. Second, we apply end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' long-horizon reasoning with deep search. To encourage diversity and reduce redundancy, we design a redundancy penalty that discourages repeated similar queries. Experiments show that DeepDive-32B achieves a new open-source competitive result on BrowseComp, outperforming WebSailor, DeepSeek-R1-Browse, and Search-o1. We demonstrate that multi-turn RL training improves deep search ability and significantly contributes to the performance improvements across multiple benchmarks. We observe that DeepDive enables test-time scaling of tool calls and parallel sampling. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/DeepDive.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimistic Multi-Agent Policy Gradient](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01953v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>*Relative overgeneralization* (RO) occurs in cooperative multi-agent learning tasks when agents converge towards a suboptimal joint policy due to overfitting to suboptimal behavior of other agents. No methods have been proposed for addressing RO in multi-agent policy gradient (MAPG) methods although these methods produce state-of-the-art results. To address this gap, we propose a general, yet simple, framework to enable optimistic updates in MAPG methods that alleviate the RO problem. Our approach involves clipping the advantage to eliminate negative values, thereby facilitating optimistic updates in MAPG. The optimism prevents individual agents from quickly converging to a local optimum. Additionally, we provide a formal analysis to show that the proposed method retains optimality at a fixed point. In extensive evaluations on a diverse set of tasks including the *Multi-agent MuJoCo* and *Overcooked* benchmarks, our method outperforms strong baselines on 13 out of 19 tested tasks and matches the performance on the rest.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated MMDP notation.

We propose AGENTIQL, an agent-inspired multi-expert framework that combines a reasoning agent for question decomposition, a coding agent for sub-query generation, and a refinement step for column selection. An adaptive router further balances efficiency and accuracy by selecting between our modular pipeline and a baseline parser. Several steps in the pipeline can be executed in parallel, making the framework scalable to larger workloads. Evaluated on the Spider benchmark, AGENTIQL improves execution accuracy and interpretability and achieves up to 86.07% EX with 14B models using the Planner&Executor merging strategy. The attained performance is contingent upon the efficacy of the routing mechanism, thereby narrowing the gap to GPT-4-based SOTA (89.65% EX) while using much smaller open-source LLMs. Beyond accuracy, AGENTIQL enhances transparency by exposing intermediate reasoning steps, offering a robust, scalable, and interpretable approach to semantic parsing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025, ER "Efficient Reasoning" workshop</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Multi-Agent Epistemic Planning through GNN-Derived Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12840v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance, resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate them against standard baselines, showing improvements in the scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.</p></details> |  |

We introduce AgentBreeder, a framework for multi-objective self-improving evolutionary search over scaffolds. We evaluate discovered scaffolds on widely recognized reasoning, mathematics, and safety benchmarks and compare them with popular baselines. In "blue" mode, we see a 79.4% average uplift in safety benchmark performance while maintaining or improving capability scores. In "red" mode, we find adversarially weak scaffolds emerging concurrently with capability optimization. Our work demonstrates the risks of multi-agent scaffolding and provides a framework for mitigating them. Code is available at https://github.com/jrosseruk/AgentBreeder.</p></details> |  |
| **[BrowserAgent: Building Web Agents with Human-Inspired Web Browsing Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10666v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently solving real-world problems with LLMs increasingly hinges on their ability to interact with dynamic web environments and autonomously acquire external information. While recent research like Search-R1 and WebDancer demonstrates strong performance in solving web tasks, they heavily rely on additional tools to convert the interactive web environment into static text content. This is in contrast to human browsing behaviors, which involve diverse interactions with the browser, such as scrolling, clicking, and typing. In this paper, we propose BrowserAgent, a more interactive agent that solves complex tasks through human-inspired browser actions. BrowserAgent operates directly on raw web pages via Playwright through a set of predefined browser actions. We adopt a two-stage training (Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT)) to improve the model's generalization abilities. Despite using significantly less training data than Search-R1, BrowserAgent achieves more competitive results across different Open-QA tasks. Additionally, we introduce an explicit memory mechanism to store key conclusions across steps, further enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities for long-horizon tasks. Notably, BrowserAgent-7B can achieve around 20\% improvement over Search-R1 on multi-hop QA tasks like HotpotQA, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle. These results indicate that BrowserAgent can serve as a more advanced framework for more interactive and scalable web agents.</p></details> | 10 pages |

By decomposing a system into simpler, interacting agents, agent-based modeling (ABM) allows researchers to observe the emergence of complex phenomena. High-performance array computing libraries like JAX can help scale such computational models to a large number of agents by using automatic vectorization and just-in-time (JIT) compilation. One of the caveats of using JAX to achieve such scaling is that the shapes of arrays used in the computational model should remain immutable throughout the simulation. In the context of agent-based modeling (ABM), this can pose constraints on certain agent manipulation operations that require flexible data structures. A subset of which is represented by the ability to update a dynamically selected number of agents by applying distinct changes to them during a simulation. To this effect, we introduce Abmax, an ABM framework based on JAX that implements multiple just-in-time (JIT) compilable algorithms to provide this functionality. On the canonical predation model benchmark, Abmax achieves runtime performance comparable to state-of-the-art implementations. Further, we show that this functionality can also be vectorized, making it possible to run many similar agent-based models in parallel. We also present two examples in the form of a traffic-flow model and a financial market model to show the use case of Abmax.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables, 2 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[Heterogeneous RBCs via deep multi-agent reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12272v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current macroeconomic models with agent heterogeneity can be broadly divided into two main groups. Heterogeneous-agent general equilibrium (GE) models, such as those based on Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) or Krusell-Smith (KS) approaches, rely on GE and 'rational expectations', somewhat unrealistic assumptions that make the models very computationally cumbersome, which in turn limits the amount of heterogeneity that can be modelled. In contrast, agent-based models (ABMs) can flexibly encompass a large number of arbitrarily heterogeneous agents, but typically require the specification of explicit behavioural rules, which can lead to a lengthy trial-and-error model-development process. To address these limitations, we introduce MARL-BC, a framework that integrates deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with Real Business Cycle (RBC) models. We demonstrate that MARL-BC can: (1) recover textbook RBC results when using a single agent; (2) recover the results of the mean-field KS model using a large number of identical agents; and (3) effectively simulate rich heterogeneity among agents, a hard task for traditional GE approaches. Our framework can be thought of as an ABM if used with a variety of heterogeneous interacting agents, and can reproduce GE results in limit cases. As such, it is a step towards a synthesis of these often opposed modelling paradigms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[DoctorAgent-RL: A Multi-Agent Collaborative Reinforcement Learning System for Multi-Turn Clinical Dialogue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19630v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in the field of biomedical question answering, but their application in real-world clinical consultations still faces core challenges. Single-round consultation systems require patients to describe all symptoms upfront, leading to vague diagnosis with unclear complaints. Traditional multi-turn dialogue models, constrained by static supervised learning, lack flexibility and fail to intelligently extract key clinical information. To address these limitations, we propose \Ours{}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent collaborative framework that models medical consultations as a dynamic decision-making process under uncertainty. The doctor agent continuously optimizes its questioning strategy within the RL framework through multi-turn interactions with the patient agent, dynamically adjusting its information-gathering path based on comprehensive rewards from the Consultation Evaluator. This RL fine-tuning mechanism enables LLMs to autonomously develop interaction strategies aligned with clinical reasoning logic, rather than superficially imitating patterns in existing dialogue data. Notably, we constructed MTMedDialog, the first English multi-turn medical consultation dataset capable of simulating patient interactions. Experiments demonstrate that \Ours{} outperforms existing models in both multi-turn reasoning capability and final diagnostic performance. This approach shows immense practical value by reducing misdiagnosis risks in time-pressured settings, freeing clinicians for complex cases, and pioneering a strategy to optimize medical resource allocation and alleviate workforce shortages.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated into ADSs to support high-level decision-making through their powerful reasoning, instruction-following, and communication abilities. However, LLM-based single-agent ADSs face three major challenges: limited perception, insufficient collaboration, and high computational demands. To address these issues, recent advances in LLM-based multi-agent ADSs leverage language-driven communication and coordination to enhance inter-agent collaboration. This paper provides a frontier survey of this emerging intersection between NLP and multi-agent ADSs. We begin with a background introduction to related concepts, followed by a categorization of existing LLM-based methods based on different agent interaction modes. We then discuss agent-human interactions in scenarios where LLM-based agents engage with humans. Finally, we summarize key applications, datasets, and challenges to support future research.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework. Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS, deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability, presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint was submitted to IEEE TrustCom 2025.

However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution. Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT, which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting. GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks. In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.</p></details> | 32 pages, 21 figures |

To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems (CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic systems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However, agentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge for conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between handling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the first conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent to integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a user query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency. For straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool for rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing module to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to the intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks using personalized recommendation tools. Evaluation on Walmart's real world career recommendation scenarios demonstrates that AdaptJobRec reduces average response latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while significantly improving recommendation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Traditional penetration testing is costly and expertise-intensive, making it difficult to scale with the growing web ecosystem. While language model agents show promise in cybersecurity, modern web applications demand visual understanding, dynamic content handling, and multi-step interactions that only computer-use agents (CUAs) can perform. Yet, their ability to discover and exploit vulnerabilities through graphical interfaces remains largely unexplored. We present HackWorld, the first framework for systematically evaluating CUAs' capabilities to exploit web application vulnerabilities via visual interaction. Unlike sanitized benchmarks, HackWorld includes 36 real-world applications across 11 frameworks and 7 languages, featuring realistic flaws such as injection vulnerabilities, authentication bypasses, and unsafe input handling. Using a Capture-the-Flag (CTF) setup, it tests CUAs' capacity to identify and exploit these weaknesses while navigating complex web interfaces. Evaluation of state-of-the-art CUAs reveals concerning trends: exploitation rates below 12% and low cybersecurity awareness. CUAs often fail at multi-step attack planning and misuse security tools. These results expose the current limitations of CUAs in web security contexts and highlight opportunities for developing more security-aware agents capable of effective vulnerability detection and exploitation.</p></details> |  |

These phenomena suggest the presence of path dependence in price formation, where investor decisions are influenced not only by current market conditions but also by the trajectory of prices leading up to the present. Path dependence has drawn attention in behavioral finance as a key mechanism behind such anomalies. One plausible driver of path dependence is human loss aversion, anchored to individual reference points like purchase prices or past peaks, which vary with personal context. However, capturing such subtle behavioral tendencies in traditional agent-based market simulations has remained a challenge. We propose the Fundamental-Chartist-LLM-Agent (FCLAgent), which uses large language models (LLMs) to emulate human-like trading decisions. In this framework, (1) buy/sell decisions are made by LLMs based on individual situations, while (2) order price and volume follow standard rule-based methods. Simulations show that FCLAgents reproduce path-dependent patterns that conventional agents fail to capture. Furthermore, an analysis of FCLAgents' behavior reveals that the reference points guiding loss aversion vary with market trajectories, highlighting the potential of LLM-based agents to model nuanced investor behavior.</p></details> |  |

Our first contribution is to precisely characterize the selection probabilities representable under this model and show that verifying the consistency of any given aggregated selection dataset reduces to solving a polynomial-sized linear program. Building on this characterization, we develop a nonparametric method for counterfactual prediction. When data is inconsistent with the model, finding a best-fitting approximation for prediction reduces to solving a compact mixed-integer convex program. Numerical experiments based on synthetic data demonstrate the method's flexibility, predictive accuracy, and strong representational power even under model misspecification.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |

We introduce DefenderBench, a practical, open-source toolkit for evaluating language agents across offense, defense, and cybersecurity knowledge-based tasks. DefenderBench includes environments for network intrusion, malicious content detection, code vulnerability analysis, and cybersecurity knowledge assessment. It is intentionally designed to be affordable and easily accessible for researchers while providing fair and rigorous assessment. We benchmark several state-of-the-art (SoTA) and popular LLMs, including both open- and closed-weight models, using a standardized agentic framework. Our results show that Claude-3.7-sonnet performs best with a DefenderBench score of 81.65, followed by Claude-3.7-sonnet-think with 78.40, while the best open-weight model, Llama 3.3 70B, is not far behind with a DefenderBench score of 71.81. DefenderBench's modular design allows seamless integration of custom LLMs and tasks, promoting reproducibility and fair comparisons.

| **[HEAL: An Empirical Study on Hallucinations in Embodied Agents Driven by Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15065v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur, what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Causal Agent based on Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06849v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The large language model (LLM) has achieved significant success across various domains. However, the inherent complexity of causal problems and causal theory poses challenges in accurately describing them in natural language, making it difficult for LLM to comprehend and use them effectively. Causal methods are not easily conveyed through natural language, which hinders LLM's ability to apply them accurately. Additionally, causal datasets are typically tabular, while LLM excels in handling natural language data, creating a structural mismatch that impedes effective reasoning with tabular data. To address these challenges, we have equipped the LLM with causal tools within an agent framework, named the Causal Agent, enabling it to tackle causal problems. The causal agent comprises tools, memory, and reasoning modules. In the tool module, the causal agent calls Python code and uses the encapsulated causal function module to align tabular data with natural language. In the reasoning module, the causal agent performs reasoning through multiple iterations with the tools. In the memory module, the causal agent maintains a dictionary instance where the keys are unique names and the values are causal graphs. To verify the causal ability of the causal agent, we established a Causal Tabular Question Answer (CausalTQA) benchmark consisting of four levels of causal problems: variable level, edge level, causal graph level, and causal effect level. CausalTQA consists of about 1.4K for these four levels questions. Causal agent demonstrates remarkable efficacy on the four-level causal problems, with accuracy rates all above 80\%. Through verification on the real-world dataset QRData, the causal agent is 6\% higher than the original SOTA. For further insights and implementation details, our code is accessible via the GitHub repository https://github.com/kairong-han/causal_agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[MapAgent: A Hierarchical Agent for Geospatial Reasoning with Dynamic Map Tool Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05933v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI has significantly extended the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling complex reasoning and tool use. However, most existing frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web automation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning, multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges, we introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with customized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial reasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools uniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different geospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level planner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to specialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then design a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs adaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the query, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction) operate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise coordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse geospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and MapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented and agentic baselines. We open-source our framwork at https://github.com/Hasebul/MapAgent.</p></details> | 27 Pages |
| **[Towards Engineering Multi-Agent LLMs: A Protocol-Driven Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12120v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for software development has driven interest in automating software engineering (SE) tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent efforts extend LLMs into multi-agent systems (MAS) that emulate collaborative development workflows, but these systems often fail due to three core deficiencies: under-specification, coordination misalignment, and inappropriate verification, arising from the absence of foundational SE structuring principles. This paper introduces Software Engineering Multi-Agent Protocol (SEMAP), a protocol-layer methodology that instantiates three core SE design principles for multi-agent LLMs: (1) explicit behavioral contract modeling, (2) structured messaging, and (3) lifecycle-guided execution with verification, and is implemented atop Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) infrastructure. Empirical evaluation using the Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy (MAST) framework demonstrates that SEMAP effectively reduces failures across different SE tasks. In code development, it achieves up to a 69.6% reduction in total failures for function-level development and 56.7% for deployment-level development. For vulnerability detection, SEMAP reduces failure counts by up to 47.4% on Python tasks and 28.2% on C/C++ tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DSPO: Stable and Efficient Policy Optimization for Agentic Search and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09255v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing LLMs with the ability to actively search external knowledge is crucial for complex and real-world tasks. Current approaches either rely on prompting to elicit the model's innate agent capabilities, or suffer from performance ceilings and collapse when applying RL to complex interactive tasks, leaving their true agentic potential untapped. To address this, we introduce \textbf{D}ynamic-filter \textbf{S}equence-level \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (DSPO), an improved RL algorithm designed for robust agent training through sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample filtering. We train our model purely through RL to interleave multi-turn search and reasoning, obviating the need for supervised demonstration data. Across multiple QA benchmarks, our 7B model improves over a comparable previous work by \textbf{34.1\%}, and even outperforms the 14B model from previous work in complex multihop QA such as HotpotQA by nearly \textbf{9\% relative}, maintaining exceptional training stability.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce ManiAgent, an agentic architecture for general manipulation tasks that achieves end-to-end output from task descriptions and environmental inputs to robotic manipulation actions. In this framework, multiple agents involve inter-agent communication to perform environmental perception, sub-task decomposition and action generation, enabling efficient handling of complex manipulation scenarios. Evaluations show ManiAgent achieves an 86.8% success rate on the SimplerEnv benchmark and 95.8% on real-world pick-and-place tasks, enabling efficient data collection that yields VLA models with performance comparable to those trained on human-annotated datasets.

By integrating large language models (LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[AI Agents as Universal Task Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12066v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense -- there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task? How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training dataset size? In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason. In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce the time needed to find solutions to new tasks. Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight. Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly considered.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph2Eval: Automatic Multimodal Task Generation for Agents via Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00507v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As multimodal LLM-driven agents continue to advance in autonomy and generalization, evaluation based on static datasets can no longer adequately assess their true capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks. Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities. In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures.

| **[Empowering LLM Agents with Geospatial Awareness: Toward Grounded Reasoning for Wildfire Response](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12061v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective disaster response is essential for safeguarding lives and property. Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models (LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL) that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure, demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases, assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines. The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and hurricanes.</p></details> |  |
| **[CausalTrace: A Neurosymbolic Causal Analysis Agent for Smart Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12033v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern manufacturing environments demand not only accurate predictions but also interpretable insights to process anomalies, root causes, and potential interventions. Existing AI systems often function as isolated black boxes, lacking the seamless integration of prediction, explanation, and causal reasoning required for a unified decision-support solution. This fragmentation limits their trustworthiness and practical utility in high-stakes industrial environments. In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal analysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and knowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery, counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time operator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering transparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN framework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration), which spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an academic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance (MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in the C3AN evaluation, demonstrating precision and reliability for live deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, Accepted at AAAI 2026: IAAI - Innovative Applications of AI Conference</p></details> |
| **[Agent Learning via Early Experience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08558v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks. However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards (e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[SAGE: A Top-Down Bottom-Up Knowledge-Grounded User Simulator for Multi-turn AGent Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11997v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating multi-turn interactive agents is challenging due to the need for human assessment. Evaluation with simulated users has been introduced as an alternative, however existing approaches typically model generic users and overlook the domain-specific principles required to capture realistic behavior. We propose SAGE, a novel user Simulation framework for multi-turn AGent Evaluation that integrates knowledge from business contexts. SAGE incorporates top-down knowledge rooted in business logic, such as ideal customer profiles, grounding user behavior in realistic customer personas. We further integrate bottom-up knowledge taken from business agent infrastructure (e.g., product catalogs, FAQs, and knowledge bases), allowing the simulator to generate interactions that reflect users' information needs and expectations in a company's target market. Through empirical evaluation, we find that this approach produces interactions that are more realistic and diverse, while also identifying up to 33% more agent errors, highlighting its effectiveness as an evaluation tool to support bug-finding and iterative agent improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Holistic Agent Leaderboard: The Missing Infrastructure for AI Agent Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11977v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second, we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across 9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategic Tradeoffs Between Humans and AI in Multi-Agent Bargaining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09071v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in collaborative human activities such as business negotiations and group coordination, it becomes critical to evaluate both the performance gains they can achieve and how they interact in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Unlike traditional statistical agents such as Bayesian models, which may excel under well-specified conditions, large language models (LLMs) can generalize across diverse, real-world scenarios, raising new questions about how their strategies and behaviors compare to those of humans and other agent types. In this work, we compare outcomes and behavioral dynamics across humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in a dynamic negotiation setting under identical conditions. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks. By establishing foundational behavioral baselines under matched conditions, this work provides a baseline for future studies in more applied, variable-rich environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Long-Horizon LLM Agent via Context-Folding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11967v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are fundamentally constrained by context length on long-horizon tasks. We introduce Context-Folding, a framework that empowers agents to actively manage their working context. An agent can procedurally branch into a sub-trajectory to handle a subtask and then fold it upon completion, collapsing the intermediate steps while retaining a concise summary of the outcome. To make this behavior learnable, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework FoldGRPO with specific process rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. On complex long-horizon tasks (Deep Research and SWE), our folding agent matches or outperforms the ReAct baselines while using an active context 10$\times$ smaller and significantly outperforms models that rely on summarization-based context management.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIDEE: Visual and Interactive Decomposition, Execution, and Evaluation of Text Analytics with Intelligent Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21582v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.). We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1) Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution, which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation, which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience -- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-WoM: Retrieval-augmented World Model For Computer-use Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11892v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as world models to enhance agent decision-making in digital environments by simulating future states and predicting action outcomes, potentially eliminating costly trial-and-error exploration. However, this capability is fundamentally limited by LLMs' tendency toward hallucination and their reliance on static training knowledge, which can lead to compounding errors that inhibit long-horizon simulations. To systematically investigate whether LLMs are appropriate for world modeling, we probe two core capabilities of world models--future state prediction and reward estimation--through three tasks: next-state identification, full-procedure planning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. Our analysis shows that while LLMs effectively capture immediate next states and identify meaningful state transitions, their performance rapidly degrades in full-procedure planning. This highlights LLMs' limitations in reliably modeling environment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, we propose the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM), which grounds LLM simulations by incorporating factual, up-to-date knowledge retrieved from external tutorials. Experiments show that R-WoM achieves substantial improvements of up to 25.3% (OSWorld) and 18.1% (WebArena) compared to baselines, with particular advantages in longer-horizon simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmoDebt: Bayesian-Optimized Emotional Intelligence for Strategic Agent-to-Agent Debt Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21080v5)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents has created a new ecosystem of strategic, agent-to-agent interactions. However, a critical challenge remains unaddressed: in high-stakes, emotion-sensitive domains like debt collection, LLM agents pre-trained on human dialogue are vulnerable to exploitation by adversarial counterparts who simulate negative emotions to derail negotiations. To fill this gap, we first contribute a novel dataset of simulated debt recovery scenarios and a multi-agent simulation framework. Within this framework, we introduce EmoDebt, an LLM agent architected for robust performance. Its core innovation is a Bayesian-optimized emotional intelligence engine that reframes a model's ability to express emotion in negotiation as a sequential decision-making problem. Through online learning, this engine continuously tunes EmoDebt's emotional transition policies, discovering optimal counter-strategies against specific debtor tactics. Extensive experiments on our proposed benchmark demonstrate that EmoDebt achieves significant strategic robustness, substantially outperforming non-adaptive and emotion-agnostic baselines across key performance metrics, including success rate and operational efficiency. By introducing both a critical benchmark and a robustly adaptive agent, this work establishes a new foundation for deploying strategically robust LLM agents in adversarial, emotion-sensitive debt interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pathology-CoT: Learning Visual Chain-of-Thought Agent from Expert Whole Slide Image Diagnosis Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04587v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnosing a whole-slide image is an interactive, multi-stage process of changing magnification and moving between fields. Although recent pathology foundation models demonstrated superior performances, practical agentic systems that decide what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable diagnoses are still lacking. Such limitation is largely bottlenecked by data: scalable, clinically aligned supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not documented in textbooks or internet, and therefore absent from LLM training. Here we introduce a framework designed to address this challenge through three key breakthroughs. First, the AI Session Recorder seamlessly integrates with standard whole-slide image viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs into standardized behavioral commands and bounding boxes. Second, a lightweight human-in-the-loop review turns AI-drafted rationales for behavioral commands into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired "where to look" and "why it matters", enabling six-fold faster labeling compared to manual constructing such Chain-of-Thought dataset. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathology-o3, a two-stage agent that first proposes important ROIs and then performs behavior-guided reasoning. On the gastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection task, our method achieved 100 recall on the internal validation from Stanford Medicine and 97.6 recall on an independent external validation from Sweden, exceeding the state-of-the-art OpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our knowledge, Pathology-CoT constitutes one of the first behavior-grounded agentic systems in pathology. Turning everyday viewer logs into scalable, expert-validated supervision, our framework makes agentic pathology practical and establishes a path to human-aligned, upgradeable clinical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical Study on Robustness and Resilience in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11824v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), it is a common practice to tune hyperparameters in ideal simulated environments to maximize cooperative performance. However, policies tuned for cooperation often fail to maintain robustness and resilience under real-world uncertainties. Building trustworthy MARL systems requires a deep understanding of robustness, which ensures stability under uncertainties, and resilience, the ability to recover from disruptions--a concept extensively studied in control systems but largely overlooked in MARL. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study comprising over 82,620 experiments to evaluate cooperation, robustness, and resilience in MARL across 4 real-world environments, 13 uncertainty types, and 15 hyperparameters. Our key findings are: (1) Under mild uncertainty, optimizing cooperation improves robustness and resilience, but this link weakens as perturbations intensify. Robustness and resilience also varies by algorithm and uncertainty type. (2) Robustness and resilience do not generalize across uncertainty modalities or agent scopes: policies robust to action noise for all agents may fail under observation noise on a single agent. (3) Hyperparameter tuning is critical for trustworthy MARL: surprisingly, standard practices like parameter sharing, GAE, and PopArt can hurt robustness, while early stopping, high critic learning rates, and Leaky ReLU consistently help. By optimizing hyperparameters only, we observe substantial improvement in cooperation, robustness and resilience across all MARL backbones, with the phenomenon also generalizing to robust MARL methods across these backbones.

| **[Demystifying Reinforcement Learning in Agentic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11701v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the emergence of agentic RL has showcased that RL could also effectively improve the agentic reasoning ability of LLMs, yet the key design principles and optimal practices remain unclear. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic investigation to demystify reinforcement learning in agentic reasoning from three key perspectives: data, algorithm, and reasoning mode. We highlight our key insights: (i) Replacing stitched synthetic trajectories with real end-to-end tool-use trajectories yields a far stronger SFT initialization; high-diversity, model-aware datasets sustain exploration and markedly improve RL performance. (ii) Exploration-friendly techniques are crucial for agentic RL, such as clip higher, overlong reward shaping, and maintaining adequate policy entropy could improve the training efficiency. (iii) A deliberative strategy with fewer tool calls outperforms frequent tool calls or verbose self-reasoning, improving tool efficiency and final accuracy. Together, these simple practices consistently enhance agentic reasoning and training efficiency, achieving strong results on challenging benchmarks with smaller models, and establishing a practical baseline for future agentic RL research. Beyond these empirical insights, we further contribute a high-quality, real end-to-end agentic SFT dataset along with a high-quality RL dataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our insights in boosting the agentic reasoning ability of LLMs across four challenging benchmarks, including AIME2024/AIME2025, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench-v6. With our recipes, 4B-sized models could also achieve superior agentic reasoning performance compared to 32B-sized models.

To address these gaps, we introduce Agent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures within a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison under real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a single-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk styles, and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them across GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.0-flash. Live experiments on both cryptocurrency and stock markets demonstrate that agent frameworks display markedly distinct behavioral patterns, spanning from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making, whereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation. AMA thus establishes a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving evaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the role of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming. In this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from a simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to analyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and optimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap the code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation evaluation. The agent is instructed to optimize the equation by utilizing these tools over a long horizon with minimal human-defined pipelines. Empirical results show that SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by an absolute margin of 6% to 35% on datasets covering four science disciplines. Additionally, we demonstrate our method's robustness to noise, the generalization of the discovered equations to out-of-domain data, and their symbolic accuracy. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework to enhance the agent's capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Most existing approaches lack transparency in their decision-making and provide limited attribution to credible sources. We introduce FinVet, a novel multi-agent framework that integrates two Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with external fact-checking through a confidence-weighted voting mechanism. FinVet employs adaptive three-tier processing that dynamically adjusts verification strategies based on retrieval confidence, from direct metadata extraction to hybrid reasoning to full model-based analysis. Unlike existing methods, FinVet provides evidence-backed verdicts, source attribution, confidence scores, and explicit uncertainty flags when evidence is insufficient. Experimental evaluation on the FinFact dataset shows that FinVet achieves an F1 score of 0.85, which is a 10.4% improvement over the best individual pipeline (fact-check pipeline) and 37% improvement over standalone RAG approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[StreamAgent: Towards Anticipatory Agents for Streaming Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01875v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this creative process, we propose a novel approach to long-form story generation, termed hybrid bottom-up long-form story generation, using multi-agent simulations. In our method, agents interact within a dynamic sandbox environment, where their behaviors and interactions with one another and the environment generate emergent events. These events form the foundation for the story, enabling organic character development and plot progression. Unlike traditional top-down approaches that impose rigid structures, our hybrid bottom-up approach allows for the natural unfolding of events, fostering more spontaneous and engaging storytelling. The system is capable of generating stories exceeding 10,000 words while maintaining coherence and consistency, addressing some of the key challenges faced by current story generation models. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across several metrics. This approach offers a scalable and innovative solution for creating dynamic, immersive long-form stories that evolve organically from agent-driven interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://storyboxproject.github.io</p></details> |

To address this, we present ParaCook, a benchmark for time-efficient collaborative planning. Inspired by the Overcooked game, ParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning of multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a simplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel planning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel actions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization. ParaCook provides a scalable evaluation framework with adjustable complexity, establishing a foundation for developing and assessing time efficiency-aware multi-agent planning. The code and data are available at https://github.com/zsq259/ParaCook.</p></details> |  |

Prior work has primarily focused on debates within homogeneous groups of agents, whereas we explore how diversity in model capabilities influences the dynamics and outcomes of multi-agent interactions. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that debate can lead to a decrease in accuracy over time - even in settings where stronger (i.e., more capable) models outnumber their weaker counterparts. Our analysis reveals that models frequently shift from correct to incorrect answers in response to peer reasoning, favoring agreement over challenging flawed reasoning. We perform additional experiments investigating various potential contributing factors to these harmful shifts - including sycophancy, social conformity, and model and task type. These results highlight important failure modes in the exchange of reasons during multi-agent debate, suggesting that naive applications of debate may cause performance degradation when agents are neither incentivised nor adequately equipped to resist persuasive but incorrect reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML MAS Workshop 2025</p></details> |

To date, the development of communication strategies that promote meat reduction while minimizing social costs has required the costly involvement of human participants at each stage of the process. We present work in progress on simulating multi-round dialogues on meat reduction between Generative Agents based on large language models (LLMs). We measure our main outcome using established psychological questionnaires based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and additionally investigate Social Costs. We find evidence that our preliminary simulations produce outcomes that are (i) consistent with theoretical expectations; and (ii) valid when compared to data from previous studies with human participants. Generative agent-based models are a promising tool for identifying novel communication strategies on meat reduction -- tailored to highly specific participant groups -- to then be tested in subsequent studies with human participants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/dess-mannheim/MeatlessAgents</p></details> |
| **[Analyzing and Internalizing Complex Policy Documents for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11588v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems rely on in-context policy documents encoding diverse business rules. As requirements grow, these documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT data.</p></details> | 42 pages |

Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content (AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video, highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems. Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts, showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvoEmo: Towards Evolved Emotional Policies for Adversarial LLM Agents in Multi-Turn Price Negotiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04310v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex}, \textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However, existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for multi-turn negotiation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Flexible Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Dynamic Routing and Scheduling of Latency-Critical Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11535v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely delivery of delay-sensitive information over dynamic, heterogeneous networks is increasingly essential for a range of interactive applications, such as industrial automation, self-driving vehicles, and augmented reality. However, most existing network control solutions target only average delay performance, falling short of providing strict End-to-End (E2E) peak latency guarantees. This paper addresses the challenge of reliably delivering packets within application-imposed deadlines by leveraging recent advancements in Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL). After introducing the Delay-Constrained Maximum-Throughput (DCMT) dynamic network control problem, and highlighting the limitations of current solutions, we present a novel MA-DRL network control framework that leverages a centralized routing and distributed scheduling architecture. The proposed framework leverages critical networking domain knowledge for the design of effective MA-DRL strategies based on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) technique, where centralized routing and distributed scheduling agents dynamically assign paths and schedule packet transmissions according to packet lifetimes, thereby maximizing on-time packet delivery. The generality of the proposed framework allows integrating both data-driven \blue{Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)} agents and traditional rule-based policies in order to strike the right balance between performance and learning complexity. Our results confirm the superiority of the proposed framework with respect to traditional stochastic optimization-based approaches and provide key insights into the role and interplay between data-driven DRL agents and new rule-based policies for both efficient and high-performance control of latency-critical services.</p></details> |  |

We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool. During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable, vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference, we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle, keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains. Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference decoupling.</p></details> |  |

Our approach combines heterogeneous agent dynamics, curriculum learning, league-play, and a newly adapted training algorithm. To this end, the decision-making process is organized into two abstraction levels: low-level policies learn precise control maneuvers, while high-level policies issue tactical commands based on mission objectives. Empirical results show that our hierarchical approach improves both learning efficiency and combat performance in complex dogfight scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Conference on Agentic AI (ICA)</p></details> |

This paper introduces an advanced security framework that extends the Task-Based Access Control (TBAC) model by using a Large Language Model (LLM) as an autonomous, risk-aware judge. This model makes access control decisions not only based on an agent's intent but also by explicitly considering the inherent \textbf{risk associated with target resources} and the LLM's own \textbf{model uncertainty} in its decision-making process. When an agent proposes a novel task, the LLM judge synthesizes a just-in-time policy while also computing a composite risk score for the task and an uncertainty estimate for its own reasoning. High-risk or high-uncertainty requests trigger more stringent controls, such as requiring human approval. This dual consideration of external risk and internal confidence allows the model to enforce a more robust and adaptive version of the principle of least privilege, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

However, many systems designed to accelerate RL post-training still suffer from low resource utilization and limited scalability. We present ROLL Flash, a system that extends ROLL with native support for asynchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash is built upon two core design principles: fine-grained parallelism and rollout-train decoupling. Guided by these principles, ROLL Flash provides flexible programming interfaces that enable a fully asynchronous training architecture and support efficient rollout mechanisms, including queue scheduling and environment-level asynchronous execution. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ROLL Flash significantly improves resource utilization and scalability over synchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash achieves up to 2.24x speedup on RLVR tasks and 2.72x on agentic tasks, using the same GPU budget as synchronous baselines. Furthermore, we implement several popular off-policy algorithms and verify that asynchronous training can achieve performance on par with synchronous training.</p></details> |  |

We propose the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous "experience-reflection-optimization" cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping stone from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation" by generating high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, EMNLP conference</p></details> |

However, existing research has focused exclusively on single-agent backdoor attacks, overlooking the novel attack surfaces introduced by agent collaboration in MAS. To bridge this gap, we present the first Distributed Backdoor Attack tailored to MAS. We decompose the backdoor into multiple distributed attack primitives that are embedded within MAS tools. These primitives remain dormant individually but collectively activate only when agents collaborate in a specific sequence, thereby assembling the full backdoor to execute targeted attacks such as data exfiltration. To fully assess this threat, we introduce a benchmark for multi-role collaborative tasks and a sandboxed framework to evaluate. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our attack achieves an attack success rate exceeding 95% without degrading performance on benign tasks. This work exposes novel backdoor attack surfaces that exploit agent collaboration, underscoring the need to move beyond single-agent protection.

The challenge is amplified by web agents' inherently complex prompts that include goals, action histories, and environmental states, leading to degraded LLM ensemble performance. To address this, we introduce WebRouter, a novel query-specific router trained from an information-theoretic perspective. Our core contribution is a cost-aware Variational Information Bottleneck (ca-VIB) objective, which learns a compressed representation of the input prompt while explicitly penalizing the expected operational cost. Experiments on five real-world websites from the WebVoyager benchmark show that WebRouter reduces operational costs by a striking 87.8\% compared to a GPT-4o baseline, while incurring only a 3.8\% accuracy drop.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraceAegis: Securing LLM-Based Agents via Hierarchical and Behavioral Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11203v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agents have demonstrated promising adaptability in real-world applications. However, these agents remain vulnerable to a wide range of attacks, such as tool poisoning and malicious instructions, that compromise their execution flow and can lead to serious consequences like data breaches and financial loss. Existing studies typically attempt to mitigate such anomalies by predefining specific rules and enforcing them at runtime to enhance safety. Yet, designing comprehensive rules is difficult, requiring extensive manual effort and still leaving gaps that result in false negatives. As agent systems evolve into complex software systems, we take inspiration from software system security and propose TraceAegis, a provenance-based analysis framework that leverages agent execution traces to detect potential anomalies. In particular, TraceAegis constructs a hierarchical structure to abstract stable execution units that characterize normal agent behaviors. These units are then summarized into constrained behavioral rules that specify the conditions necessary to complete a task. By validating execution traces against both hierarchical and behavioral constraints, TraceAegis is able to effectively detect abnormal behaviors. To evaluate the effectiveness of TraceAegis, we introduce TraceAegis-Bench, a dataset covering two representative scenarios: healthcare and corporate procurement. Each scenario includes 1,300 benign behaviors and 300 abnormal behaviors, where the anomalies either violate the agent's execution order or break the semantic consistency of its execution sequence. Experimental results demonstrate that TraceAegis achieves strong performance on TraceAegis-Bench, successfully identifying the majority of abnormal behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent-Based Modelling for Real-World Stock Markets under Behavioral Economic Principles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12987v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reproduction of realistic dynamics in financial markets is of great significance, as it enhances our understanding of market evolution beyond other physical processes, and facilitates the development and backtesting of investment strategies. Most existing literature approaches this issue as a time series forecasting problem, which often faces challenges such as 1) overfitting historical data, 2) failing to reconstruct stylized facts, and 3) limiting users' ability to conduct counterfactual analyses. To address these limitations, we employ agent-based modeling (ABM) for market simulation, where each trader acts as an autonomous agent guided by established behavioral-economic principles. The parameters of the agent model are subsequently calibrated using deep learning techniques. Additionally, we align our agent model with publicly available economic indices, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), to enhance the explainability of our system's outcomes. Our experiments demonstrate that the ABM method effectively reproduces market dynamics with a confidence level of 90%, accurately reflecting well-known stylized facts. Furthermore, the calibration process proves to be more computationally efficient compared to other existing methods that perform simulation-based inference. We also present case studies illustrating the correlation between agent parameters and economic indices.</p></details> |  |

Prompt-centric LLM agents (e.g., ReAct, Reflexion) must re-interpret large, evolving game states each turn, quickly saturating context windows and losing strategic consistency. We propose HexMachina, a continual learning multi-agent system that separates environment discovery (inducing an adapter layer without documentation) from strategy improvement (evolving a compiled player through code refinement and simulation). This design preserves executable artifacts, allowing the LLM to focus on high-level strategy rather than per-turn reasoning. In controlled Catanatron experiments, HexMachina learns from scratch and evolves players that outperform the strongest human-crafted baseline (AlphaBeta), achieving a 54% win rate and surpassing prompt-driven and no-discovery baselines. Ablations confirm that isolating pure strategy learning improves performance. Overall, artifact-centric continual learning transforms LLMs from brittle stepwise deciders into stable strategy designers, advancing long-horizon autonomy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Reward Miscalibration of GRPO in Agentic RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23870v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building autonomous agents capable of solving long-horizon, real-world tasks has garnered significant research interest. But outcome based rewards may cause reward miscalibration which means it might mistakenly allocate positive reward to flawed middle steps which is regarded as the key reason making the bad actions being reinforced during training. However we reveal that outcome based reward ensures expected negative advantage for those flawed middle steps, which means the flawed actions should be punished during training. Even accounting for the ``squeezing effect", the probability mass of good actions should increase and the actor should gradually get rid of harmful actions. This shows that flawed actions should be punished during training. We further identify gradient coupling between similar samples as a key issue in agentic RL, the input prompt is extremely similar and the output action space is limited, therefore during training, gradients from well-performing samples can inadvertently strengthen suboptimal or incorrect actions due to similar input observation and output actions. We show that with gradient coupling, some flawed actions might be enhanced. To address this, we propose training the actor to classify good or bad actions to separate the embedding of good/bad actions and alleviate the gradient interference, extensive experiments shows its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Vision for Access Control in LLM-based Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11108v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The autonomy and contextual complexity of LLM-based agents render traditional access control (AC) mechanisms insufficient. Static, rule-based systems designed for predictable environments are fundamentally ill-equipped to manage the dynamic information flows inherent in agentic interactions. This position paper argues for a paradigm shift from binary access control to a more sophisticated model of information governance, positing that the core challenge is not merely about permission, but about governing the flow of information. We introduce Agent Access Control (AAC), a novel framework that reframes AC as a dynamic, context-aware process of information flow governance. AAC operates on two core modules: (1) multi-dimensional contextual evaluation, which assesses not just identity but also relationships, scenarios, and norms; and (2) adaptive response formulation, which moves beyond simple allow/deny decisions to shape information through redaction, summarization, and paraphrasing. This vision, powered by a dedicated AC reasoning engine, aims to bridge the gap between human-like nuanced judgment and scalable Al safety, proposing a new conceptual lens for future research in trustworthy agent design.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |

Building upon a previously established multi-level intelligent agent economic model, this paper conducts simulation-based comparisons of macroeconomic output evolution in China and the United States under different mechanisms-AI collaboration, network effects, and AI autonomous production. The results show that: (1) when AI functions as an independent productive entity, the overall growth rate of social output far exceeds that of traditional human-labor-based models; (2) China demonstrates clear potential for acceleration in both the expansion of intelligent agent populations and the pace of technological catch-up, offering the possibility of achieving technological convergence or even partial surpassing. This study provides a systematic, model-based analytical framework for understanding AI-driven production system transformation and shifts in international competitiveness, as well as quantitative insights for relevant policy formulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[DebugTA: An LLM-Based Agent for Simplifying Debugging and Teaching in Programming Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11076v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In programming education, Debugging and Teaching (DT) task is a common scenario where students receive assistance in correcting their erroneous code. The task involves multiple inputs, including erroneous code, error messages, reference solutions, and the question description, with the goal of generating modification suggestions to the erroneous code. However, two key challenges hinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and heterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the reasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to fully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to rely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs in addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose DebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools for standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and an external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit pedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes a complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools for specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step and reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool calls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible, allowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and improving the accuracy of the generated suggestions. To rigorously assess the quality of modification suggestions, we introduce a student simulator-teacher interaction paradigm. Experimental results on three real-world code datasets demonstrate that DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Systems in Radiology: Design, Applications, Evaluation, and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09404v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information, follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources. Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Static to Adaptive Defense: Federated Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning-Driven Moving Target Defense Against DoS Attacks in UAV Swarm Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07392v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of UAVs has enabled a wide range of mission-critical applications and is becoming a cornerstone of low-altitude networks, supporting smart cities, emergency response, and more. However, the open wireless environment, dynamic topology, and resource constraints of UAVs expose low-altitude networks to severe DoS threats. Traditional defense approaches, which rely on fixed configurations or centralized decision-making, cannot effectively respond to the rapidly changing conditions in UAV swarm environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (FMADRL)-driven moving target defense (MTD) framework for proactive DoS mitigation in low-altitude networks. Specifically, we design lightweight and coordinated MTD mechanisms, including leader switching, route mutation, and frequency hopping, to disrupt attacker efforts and enhance network resilience. The defense problem is formulated as a multi-agent partially observable Markov decision process, capturing the uncertain nature of UAV swarms under attack. Each UAV is equipped with a policy agent that autonomously selects MTD actions based on partial observations and local experiences. By employing a policy gradient-based algorithm, UAVs collaboratively optimize their policies via reward-weighted aggregation. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 34.6% improvement in attack mitigation rate, a reduction in average recovery time of up to 94.6%, and decreases in energy consumption and defense cost by as much as 29.3% and 98.3%, respectively, under various DoS attack strategies. These results highlight the potential of intelligent, distributed defense mechanisms to protect low-altitude networks, paving the way for reliable and scalable low-altitude economy.</p></details> | <details><summary>15pag...</summary><p>15pages; Minor Revision for IEEE TCCN</p></details> |

We introduce SusBench, an online benchmark for evaluating the susceptibility of CUAs to UI dark patterns, designs that aim to manipulate or deceive users into taking unintentional actions. Drawing nine common dark pattern types from existing taxonomies, we developed a method for constructing believable dark patterns on real-world consumer websites through code injections, and designed 313 evaluation tasks across 55 websites. Our study with 29 participants showed that humans perceived our dark pattern injections to be highly realistic, with the vast majority of participants not noticing that these had been injected by the research team. We evaluated five state-of-the-art CUAs on the benchmark. We found that both human participants and agents are particularly susceptible to the dark patterns of Preselection, Trick Wording, and Hidden Information, while being resilient to other overt dark patterns. Our findings inform the development of more trustworthy CUAs, their use as potential human proxies in evaluating deceptive designs, and the regulation of an online environment increasingly navigated by autonomous agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProSEA: Problem Solving via Exploration Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07423v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed. Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA, even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive, and human-aligned AI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[DemonAgent: Dynamically Encrypted Multi-Backdoor Implantation Attack on LLM-based Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12575v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLM-based agents become increasingly prevalent, backdoors can be implanted into agents through user queries or environment feedback, raising critical concerns regarding safety vulnerabilities. However, backdoor attacks are typically detectable by safety audits that analyze the reasoning process of agents. To this end, we propose a novel backdoor implantation strategy called \textbf{Dynamically Encrypted Multi-Backdoor Implantation Attack}. Specifically, we introduce dynamic encryption, which maps the backdoor into benign content, effectively circumventing safety audits. To enhance stealthiness, we further decompose the backdoor into multiple sub-backdoor fragments. Based on these advancements, backdoors are allowed to bypass safety audits significantly. Additionally, we present AgentBackdoorEval, a dataset designed for the comprehensive evaluation of agent backdoor attacks. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an attack success rate nearing 100\% while maintaining a detection rate of 0\%, illustrating its effectiveness in evading safety audits. Our findings highlight the limitations of existing safety mechanisms in detecting advanced attacks, underscoring the urgent need for more robust defenses against backdoor threats.

Existing benchmarks rely on surface-level metrics that fail to capture the distinctive traits of this genre. To address these gaps, we introduce DITING, the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation, assessing narrative and cultural fidelity across six dimensions: idiom translation, lexical ambiguity, terminology localization, tense consistency, zero-pronoun resolution, and cultural safety, supported by over 18K expert-annotated Chinese-English sentence pairs. We further propose AgentEval, a reasoning-driven multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates expert deliberation to assess translation quality beyond lexical overlap, achieving the highest correlation with human judgments among seven tested automatic metrics. To enable metric comparison, we develop MetricAlign, a meta-evaluation dataset of 300 sentence pairs annotated with error labels and scalar quality scores. Comprehensive evaluation of fourteen open, closed, and commercial models reveals that Chinese-trained LLMs surpass larger foreign counterparts, and that DeepSeek-V3 delivers the most faithful and stylistically coherent translations. Our work establishes a new paradigm for exploring LLM-based web novel translation and provides public resources to advance future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating Structural Engineering Workflows with Large Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11004v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce $\textbf{MASSE}$, the first Multi-Agent System for Structural Engineering, effectively integrating large language model (LLM)-based agents with real-world engineering workflows. Structural engineering is a fundamental yet traditionally stagnant domain, with core workflows remaining largely unchanged for decades despite its substantial economic impact and global market size. Recent advancements in LLMs have significantly enhanced their ability to perform complex reasoning, long-horizon planning, and precise tool utilization -- capabilities well aligned with structural engineering tasks such as interpreting design codes, executing load calculations, and verifying structural capacities. We present a proof-of-concept showing that most real-world structural engineering workflows can be fully automated through a training-free LLM-based multi-agent system. MASSE enables immediate deployment in professional environments, and our comprehensive validation on real-world case studies demonstrates that it can reduce expert workload from approximately two hours to mere minutes, while enhancing both reliability and accuracy in practical engineering scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/DelosLiang/masse</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10991v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems, research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static, passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation, whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii) Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also actively update a public repository at https://github.com/HJYao00/Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Optimizations of LLM Ensembles with Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04492v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of LLMs and their accessibility have triggered renewed interest in multi-agent reinforcement learning as robust and adaptive frameworks for dynamically changing environments. This paper introduces RL-Focal, a two-stage RL agent framework that routes and ensembles LLMs. First, we develop the Decider RL-agent, which learns to dynamically select an ensemble of small size ($m_i$) among $N$ LLMs ($m_i \ll N$) for incoming queries from a user-defined downstream task $i$, by maximizing both error-diversity and reasoning-performance of the selected ensemble through iterative updates of task-adaptive rewards and policy. Second, to enable effective fusion of dynamically selected LLMs, we develop the stage-2 Fusion RL-agent, which learns to resolve reasoning conflicts from different LLMs and dynamically adapts to different ensemble teams composed by the Decider Agent for different downstream tasks. Third, we introduce the focal diversity metric to better model the error correlations among multiple LLMs, further improving the generalization performance of the Decider Agent, which actively prunes the ensemble combinations. By focal diversity, we enhance performance across tasks by effectively promoting reward-aware and policy-adaptive ensemble selection and inference fusion. Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks show that RL-Focal achieves the performance improvement of 8.48\% with an ensemble of small size compared to the best individual LLM in a pool and offers stronger robustness.

| **[The Social Cost of Intelligence: Emergence, Propagation, and Amplification of Stereotypical Bias in Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10943v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bias in large language models (LLMs) remains a persistent challenge, manifesting in stereotyping and unfair treatment across social groups. While prior research has primarily focused on individual models, the rise of multi-agent systems (MAS), where multiple LLMs collaborate and communicate, introduces new and largely unexplored dynamics in bias emergence and propagation. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of stereotypical bias in MAS, examining how internal specialization, underlying LLMs and inter-agent communication protocols influence bias robustness, propagation, and amplification. We simulate social contexts where agents represent different social groups and evaluate system behavior under various interaction and adversarial scenarios. Experiments on three bias benchmarks reveal that MAS are generally less robust than single-agent systems, with bias often emerging early through in-group favoritism. However, cooperative and debate-based communication can mitigate bias amplification, while more robust underlying LLMs improve overall system stability. Our findings highlight critical factors shaping fairness and resilience in multi-agent LLM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 19 figures, Preprint.

| **[Neutral Agent-based Adversarial Policy Learning against Deep Reinforcement Learning in Multi-party Open Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10937v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and dependent on interactions with victim agents. To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[PoU: Proof-of-Use to Counter Tool-Call Hacking in DeepResearch Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10931v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, such as recent DeepResearch-style systems, extend large language models (LLMs) with autonomous information-seeking capabilities through external tools. While reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled impressive multi-step reasoning, we identify a previously overlooked failure mode, Tool-Call Hacking, where agents inflate reward signals by issuing superficially correct tool calls without genuinely leveraging the retrieved evidence. This results in (i) mode collapse into repetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where answers are only weakly supported by cited content. To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL framework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence, reasoning traces, and final answers. PoU operationalizes this through a unified step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives, ensuring that tool usage remains both interpretable and functionally grounded. Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and out-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and tool-routing balance. These findings highlight the necessity of grounding RL-trained agents not merely in task outcomes but in the causal use of retrieved information, offering a principled path toward trustworthy retrieval-augmented reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[PaperArena: An Evaluation Benchmark for Tool-Augmented Agentic Reasoning on Scientific Literature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10909v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78% average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%, highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage, often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for scientific discovery. Our code and data are available https://github.com/Melmaphother/PaperArena.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

Despite the promising potential of large language models (LLMs)-based agent for software optimization, automating compiler optimization remains challenging due to: (1) semantic misalignment between abstract program representations and concrete optimization passes, (2) inefficient interaction mechanisms between agents and compiler environments, and (3) reward sparsity from the extensive decision-making process within large optimization spaces. This paper introduces \textbf{AwareCompiler}, an agentic framework for compiler optimization that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: structured knowledge integration and dataset construction, knowledge-driven adaptive pass generation, and data-driven hybrid training pipeline. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that AwareCompiler significantly outperforms existing baselines in both performance and efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of our synergistic knowledge-data-driven approach.

While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based protocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor generalizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to dynamic environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the uplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user equipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG), capturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game, LLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO), synthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics. Protocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and efficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence and convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the learning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing followers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater throughput and a 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines. Besides, our framework generalizes excellently to a fluctuating number of users without requiring retraining or architectural changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Building on the prior work, LLM x MapReduce-V2, this version incorporates a multi-agent architecture where individual functional components, such as skeleton initialization, digest construction, and skeleton refinement, are implemented as independent model-context-protocol (MCP) servers. These atomic servers can be aggregated into higher-level servers, creating a hierarchically structured system. A high-level planner agent dynamically orchestrates the workflow by selecting appropriate modules based on their MCP tool descriptions and the execution history. This modular decomposition facilitates human-in-the-loop intervention, affording users greater control and customization over the research process. Through a multi-turn interaction, the system precisely captures the intended research perspectives to generate a comprehensive skeleton, which is then developed into an in-depth survey. Human evaluations demonstrate that our system surpasses representative baselines in both content depth and length, highlighting the strength of MCP-based modular planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2025 System Demonstration</p></details> |

A key challenge in this space is the continual need to migrate and modernize codebases in response to evolving software ecosystems. Traditionally, such migrations have relied on rule-based systems and human intervention. With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), AI-driven agentic frameworks offer a promising alternative-but their effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we introduce FreshBrew, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agents on project-level Java migrations, with a specific focus on measuring an agent's ability to preserve program semantics and avoid reward hacking, which we argue requires projects with high test coverage for a rigorous and reliable evaluation. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs, and compare their performance against established rule-based tools. Our evaluation of AI agents on this benchmark of 228 repositories shows that the top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Flash, can successfully migrate 52.3 percent of projects to JDK 17. Our empirical analysis reveals novel insights into the critical strengths and limitations of current agentic approaches, offering actionable insights into their real-world applicability. Our empirical study reveals failure modes of current AI agents in realistic Java modernization tasks, providing a foundation for evaluating trustworthy code-migration systems. By releasing FreshBrew, we aim to facilitate rigorous, reproducible evaluation and catalyze progress in AI-driven codebase modernization.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |

The system achieves remarkable accuracy improvements from 65% to 94.8% while ensuring comprehensive document traceability throughout the quality engineering lifecycle. Experimental validation of enterprise Corporate Systems Engineering and SAP migration projects demonstrates an 85% reduction in testing timeline, an 85% improvement in test suite efficiency, and projected 35% cost savings, resulting in a 2-month acceleration of go-live.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs as Strategic Agents: Beliefs, Best Response Behavior, and Emergent Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10813v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to domains that require reasoning about other agents' behavior, such as negotiation, policy design, and market simulation, yet existing research has mostly evaluated their adherence to equilibrium play or their exhibited depth of reasoning. Whether they display genuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those beliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by disentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information games, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly analyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents, revealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity, explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice that are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These findings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic formation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a structured basis for the study of strategic cognition in artificial agents.</p></details> |  |
