| **[Beyond Simple Edits: Composed Video Retrieval with Dense Modifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14039v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense modification text that is around seven times more than its existing counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder, enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense modification texts. Our proposed dataset, code, and model are available at :https://github.com/OmkarThawakar/BSE-CoVR</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV-2025</p></details> |
| **[From Play to Replay: Composed Video Retrieval for Temporally Fine-Grained Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05274v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) retrieves a target video given a query video and a modification text describing the intended change. Existing CoVR benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct each <query, modification> pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image, video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR, TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoVR-2: Automatic Data Construction for Composed Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14746v4)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CoIR) has recently gained popularity as a task that considers both text and image queries together, to search for relevant images in a database. Most CoIR approaches require manually annotated datasets, comprising image-text-image triplets, where the text describes a modification from the query image to the target image. However, manual curation of CoIR triplets is expensive and prevents scalability. In this work, we instead propose a scalable automatic dataset creation methodology that generates triplets given video-caption pairs, while also expanding the scope of the task to include composed video retrieval (CoVR). To this end, we mine paired videos with a similar caption from a large database, and leverage a large language model to generate the corresponding modification text. Applying this methodology to the extensive WebVid2M collection, we automatically construct our WebVid-CoVR dataset, resulting in 1.6 million triplets. Moreover, we introduce a new benchmark for CoVR with a manually annotated evaluation set, along with baseline results. We further validate that our methodology is equally applicable to image-caption pairs, by generating 3.3 million CoIR training triplets using the Conceptual Captions dataset. Our model builds on BLIP-2 pretraining, adapting it to composed video (or image) retrieval, and incorporates an additional caption retrieval loss to exploit extra supervision beyond the triplet. We provide extensive ablations to analyze the design choices on our new CoVR benchmark. Our experiments also demonstrate that training a CoVR model on our datasets effectively transfers to CoIR, leading to improved state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot setup on the CIRR, FashionIQ, and CIRCO benchmarks. Our code, datasets, and models are publicly available at https://imagine.enpc.fr/~ventural/covr/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears in TPAMI 2024 (DOI: 10.1109/TPAMI.2024.3463799).

| **[EgoCVR: An Egocentric Benchmark for Fine-Grained Composed Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16658v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Composed Video Retrieval, a video and a textual description which modifies the video content are provided as inputs to the model. The aim is to retrieve the relevant video with the modified content from a database of videos. In this challenging task, the first step is to acquire large-scale training datasets and collect high-quality benchmarks for evaluation. In this work, we introduce EgoCVR, a new evaluation benchmark for fine-grained Composed Video Retrieval using large-scale egocentric video datasets. EgoCVR consists of 2,295 queries that specifically focus on high-quality temporal video understanding. We find that existing Composed Video Retrieval frameworks do not achieve the necessary high-quality temporal video understanding for this task. To address this shortcoming, we adapt a simple training-free method, propose a generic re-ranking framework for Composed Video Retrieval, and demonstrate that this achieves strong results on EgoCVR. Our code and benchmark are freely available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/EgoCVR.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |
| **[Composed Video Retrieval via Enriched Context and Discriminative Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16997v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed video retrieval (CoVR) is a challenging problem in computer vision which has recently highlighted the integration of modification text with visual queries for more sophisticated video search in large databases. Existing works predominantly rely on visual queries combined with modification text to distinguish relevant videos. However, such a strategy struggles to fully preserve the rich query-specific context in retrieved target videos and only represents the target video using visual embedding. We introduce a novel CoVR framework that leverages detailed language descriptions to explicitly encode query-specific contextual information and learns discriminative embeddings of vision only, text only and vision-text for better alignment to accurately retrieve matched target videos. Our proposed framework can be flexibly employed for both composed video (CoVR) and image (CoIR) retrieval tasks. Experiments on three datasets show that our approach obtains state-of-the-art performance for both CovR and zero-shot CoIR tasks, achieving gains as high as around 7% in terms of recall@K=1 score. Our code, models, detailed language descriptions for WebViD-CoVR dataset are available at \url{https://github.com/OmkarThawakar/composed-video-retrieval}</p></details> | CVPR-2024 |

| **[Instance-Level Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25387v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives. To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page: https://vrg.fel.cvut.cz/icir/.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Automatic Synthesis of High-Quality Triplet Data for Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05970v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a challenging vision-language (VL) task, Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images using multimodal (image+text) queries. Although many existing CIR methods have attained promising performance, their reliance on costly, manually labeled triplets hinders scalability and zero-shot capability. To address this issue, we propose a scalable pipeline for automatic triplet generation, along with a fully synthetic dataset named Composed Image Retrieval on High-quality Synthetic Triplets (CIRHS). Our pipeline leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts, controlling a text-to-image generative model to produce image pairs with identical elements in each pair, which are then filtered and reorganized to form the CIRHS dataset. In addition, we introduce Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a novel CIR framework, which can accomplish global alignment and local reasoning within a broader context, enabling the model to learn more robust and informative representations. By utilizing the synthetic CIRHS dataset, CoAlign achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on three commonly used benchmarks, demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of training CIR models on a fully synthetic dataset. Furthermore, under supervised training, our method outperforms all the state-of-the-art supervised CIR approaches, validating the effectiveness of our proposed retrieval framework. The code and the CIRHS dataset will be released soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was originally submitted to ACM MM 2025 on April 12, 2025</p></details> |
| **[CIR-CoT: Towards Interpretable Composed Image Retrieval via End-to-End Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08003v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption, reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset, establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SQUARE: Semantic Query-Augmented Fusion and Efficient Batch Reranking for Training-free Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26330v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality. In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |
| **[SETR: A Two-Stage Semantic-Enhanced Framework for Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26012v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1) union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues, carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR, Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance, improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.</p></details> |  |
| **[PDV: Prompt Directional Vectors for Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07215v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) enables image search using a reference image and a text prompt without requiring specialized text-image composition networks trained on large-scale paired data. However, current ZS-CIR approaches suffer from three critical limitations in their reliance on composed text embeddings: static query embedding representations, insufficient utilization of image embeddings, and suboptimal performance when fusing text and image embeddings. To address these challenges, we introduce the \textbf{Prompt Directional Vector (PDV)}, a simple yet effective training-free enhancement that captures semantic modifications induced by user prompts. PDV enables three key improvements: (1) Dynamic composed text embeddings where prompt adjustments are controllable via a scaling factor, (2) composed image embeddings through semantic transfer from text prompts to image features, and (3) weighted fusion of composed text and image embeddings that enhances retrieval by balancing visual and semantic similarity. Our approach serves as a plug-and-play enhancement for existing ZS-CIR methods with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PDV consistently improves retrieval performance when integrated with state-of-the-art ZS-CIR approaches, particularly for methods that generate accurate compositional embeddings. The code will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Thought Re-ranking for Image Retrieval Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14746v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image retrieval remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in computer vision. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods typically employ them only for evaluation, without involving them directly in the ranking process. As a result, their rich multimodal reasoning abilities remain underutilized, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Chain-of-Thought Re-Ranking (CoTRR) method to address this issue. Specifically, we design a listwise ranking prompt that enables MLLM to directly participate in re-ranking candidate images. This ranking process is grounded in an image evaluation prompt, which assesses how well each candidate aligns with users query. By allowing MLLM to perform listwise reasoning, our method supports global comparison, consistent reasoning, and interpretable decision-making - all of which are essential for accurate image retrieval. To enable structured and fine-grained analysis, we further introduce a query deconstruction prompt, which breaks down the original query into multiple semantic components. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our CoTRR method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across three image retrieval tasks, including text-to-image retrieval (TIR), composed image retrieval (CIR) and chat-based image retrieval (Chat-IR). Our code is available at https://github.com/freshfish15/CoTRR .</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Supervised Composed Image Retrieval via Reasoning-Augmented Representation Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11272v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) presents a significant challenge as it requires jointly understanding a reference image and a modified textual instruction to find relevant target images. Some existing methods attempt to use a two-stage approach to further refine retrieval results. However, this often requires additional training of a ranking model. Despite the success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in reducing training costs for language models, their application in CIR tasks remains limited -- compressing visual information into text or relying on elaborate prompt designs. Besides, existing works only utilize it for zero-shot CIR, as it is challenging to achieve satisfactory results in supervised CIR with a well-trained model. In this work, we proposed a framework that includes the Pyramid Matching Model with Training-Free Refinement (PMTFR) to address these challenges. Through a simple but effective module called Pyramid Patcher, we enhanced the Pyramid Matching Model's understanding of visual information at different granularities. Inspired by representation engineering, we extracted representations from COT data and injected them into the LVLMs. This approach allowed us to obtain refined retrieval scores in the Training-Free Refinement paradigm without relying on explicit textual reasoning, further enhancing performance. Extensive experiments on CIR benchmarks demonstrate that PMTFR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in supervised CIR tasks. The code will be made public.</p></details> |  |
| **[Composed Object Retrieval: Object-level Retrieval via Composed Expressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04424v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieving fine-grained visual content based on user intent remains a challenge in multi-modal systems. Although current Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) methods combine reference images with retrieval texts, they are constrained to image-level matching and cannot localize specific objects. To this end, we propose Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a brand-new task that goes beyond image-level retrieval to achieve object-level precision, allowing the retrieval and segmentation of target objects based on composed expressions combining reference objects and retrieval texts. COR presents significant challenges in retrieval flexibility, which requires systems to identify arbitrary objects satisfying composed expressions while avoiding semantically similar but irrelevant negative objects within the same scene. We construct COR127K, the first large-scale COR benchmark that contains 127,166 retrieval triplets with various semantic transformations in 408 categories. We also present CORE, a unified end-to-end model that integrates reference region encoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CORE significantly outperforms existing models in both base and novel categories, establishing a simple and effective baseline for this challenging task while opening new directions for fine-grained multi-modal retrieval research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modality and Task Adaptation for Enhanced Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23736v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a challenging vision-language task, Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) is designed to retrieve target images using bi-modal (image+text) queries. Typical ZS-CIR methods employ an inversion network to generate pseudo-word tokens that effectively represent the input semantics. However, the inversion-based methods suffer from two inherent issues: First, the task discrepancy exists because inversion training and CIR inference involve different objectives. Second, the modality discrepancy arises from the input feature distribution mismatch between training and inference. To this end, we propose a lightweight post-hoc framework, consisting of two components: (1) A new text-anchored triplet construction pipeline leverages a large language model (LLM) to transform a standard image-text dataset into a triplet dataset, where a textual description serves as the target of each triplet. (2) The MoTa-Adapter, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, adapts the dual encoder to the CIR task using our constructed triplet data. Specifically, on the text side, multiple sets of learnable task prompts are integrated via a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layer to capture task-specific priors and handle different types of modifications. On the image side, MoTa-Adapter modulates the inversion network's input to better match the downstream text encoder. In addition, an entropy-based optimization strategy is proposed to assign greater weight to challenging samples, thus ensuring efficient adaptation. Experiments show that, with the incorporation of our proposed components, inversion-based methods achieve significant improvements, reaching state-of-the-art performance across four widely-used benchmarks. All data and code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[iSEARLE: Improving Textual Inversion for Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02951v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a query consisting of a reference image and a relative caption, Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images visually similar to the reference one while incorporating the changes specified in the relative caption. The reliance of supervised methods on labor-intensive manually labeled datasets hinders their broad applicability. In this work, we introduce a new task, Zero-Shot CIR (ZS-CIR), that addresses CIR without the need for a labeled training dataset. We propose an approach named iSEARLE (improved zero-Shot composEd imAge Retrieval with textuaL invErsion) that involves mapping the visual information of the reference image into a pseudo-word token in CLIP token embedding space and combining it with the relative caption. To foster research on ZS-CIR, we present an open-domain benchmarking dataset named CIRCO (Composed Image Retrieval on Common Objects in context), the first CIR dataset where each query is labeled with multiple ground truths and a semantic categorization. The experimental results illustrate that iSEARLE obtains state-of-the-art performance on three different CIR datasets -- FashionIQ, CIRR, and the proposed CIRCO -- and two additional evaluation settings, namely domain conversion and object composition. The dataset, the code, and the model are publicly available at https://github.com/miccunifi/SEARLE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TPAMI, extended version of the ICCV2023 paper arXiv:2303.15247</p></details> |
| **[U-MARVEL: Unveiling Key Factors for Universal Multimodal Retrieval via Embedding Learning with MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14902v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal multimodal retrieval (UMR), which aims to address complex retrieval tasks where both queries and candidates span diverse modalities, has been significantly advanced by the emergence of MLLMs. While state-of-the-art MLLM-based methods in the literature predominantly adopt contrastive learning principles, they often differ in their specific training recipes. Despite their success, the mechanisms underlying their retrieval capabilities remain largely unexplored, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance and limited generalization ability. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive study aimed at uncovering the key factors that drive effective embedding learning for UMR using MLLMs. We begin by implementing a general MLLM-based embedding learning pipeline, and systematically analyze the primary contributors to high-performing universal retrieval systems. Based on this, we explore various aspects of the details in embedding generation and training strategies, including progressive transition, hard negative mining and re-ranker distillation. Notably, our findings reveal that often-overlooked factors can have a substantial impact on model performance. Building on these discoveries, we introduce a unified framework termed U-MARVEL (\textbf{U}niversal \textbf{M}ultimod\textbf{A}l \textbf{R}etrie\textbf{V}al via \textbf{E}mbedding \textbf{L}earning), which outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on the M-BEIR benchmark by a large margin in supervised settings, and also exihibits strong zero-shot performance on several tasks such as composed image retrieval and text-to-video retrieval. These results underscore the generalization potential of our framework across various embedding-based retrieval tasks.

While effectively fusing visual and textual modalities is crucial, existing methods typically adopt either early or late fusion. Early fusion tends to excessively focus on explicitly mentioned textual details and neglect visual context, whereas late fusion struggles to capture fine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens. To address these issues, we propose FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework designed with enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation, integrating two complementary modules. The enhanced semantic alignment module (ESAM) employs late fusion with cross-attention to capture fine-grained semantic relationships, while the adaptive reconciliation module (ARM) applies early fusion with uncertainty embeddings to enhance robustness and adaptability. Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show consistent performance gains, improving Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over existing state-of-the-art methods, empirically demonstrating that FAR Net provides a robust and scalable solution to CIR tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text, without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 2025 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics</p></details> |
| **[QuRe: Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling in Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12416v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves relevant images based on a reference image and accompanying text describing desired modifications. However, existing CIR methods only focus on retrieving the target image and disregard the relevance of other images. This limitation arises because most methods employing contrastive learning-which treats the target image as positive and all other images in the batch as negatives-can inadvertently include false negatives. This may result in retrieving irrelevant images, reducing user satisfaction even when the target image is retrieved. To address this issue, we propose Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling (QuRe), which optimizes a reward model objective to reduce false negatives. Additionally, we introduce a hard negative sampling strategy that selects images positioned between two steep drops in relevance scores following the target image, to effectively filter false negatives. In order to evaluate CIR models on their alignment with human satisfaction, we create Human-Preference FashionIQ (HP-FashionIQ), a new dataset that explicitly captures user preferences beyond target retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuRe achieves state-of-the-art performance on FashionIQ and CIRR datasets while exhibiting the strongest alignment with human preferences on the HP-FashionIQ dataset.

| **[FACap: A Large-scale Fashion Dataset for Fine-grained Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07135v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2, which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites.

| **[OFFSET: Segmentation-based Focus Shift Revision for Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05631v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) represents a novel retrieval paradigm that is capable of expressing users' intricate retrieval requirements flexibly. It enables the user to give a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a modification text, and subsequently retrieve the target image. Notwithstanding the considerable advances made by prevailing methodologies, CIR remains in its nascent stages due to two limitations: 1) inhomogeneity between dominant and noisy portions in visual data is ignored, leading to query feature degradation, and 2) the priority of textual data in the image modification process is overlooked, which leads to a visual focus bias. To address these two limitations, this work presents a focus mapping-based feature extractor, which consists of two modules: dominant portion segmentation and dual focus mapping. It is designed to identify significant dominant portions in images and guide the extraction of visual and textual data features, thereby reducing the impact of noise interference. Subsequently, we propose a textually guided focus revision module, which can utilize the modification requirements implied in the text to perform adaptive focus revision on the reference image, thereby enhancing the perception of the modification focus on the composed features. The aforementioned modules collectively constitute the segmentatiOn-based Focus shiFt reviSion nETwork (\mbox{OFFSET}), and comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets substantiate the superiority of our proposed method.

| **[Scaling Prompt Instructed Zero Shot Composed Image Retrieval with Image-Only Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00812v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving images matching a reference image augmented with a text, where the text describes changes to the reference image in natural language. Traditionally, models designed for CIR have relied on triplet data containing a reference image, reformulation text, and a target image. However, curating such triplet data often necessitates human intervention, leading to prohibitive costs. This challenge has hindered the scalability of CIR model training even with the availability of abundant unlabeled data. With the recent advances in foundational models, we advocate a shift in the CIR training paradigm where human annotations can be efficiently replaced by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we demonstrate the capability of large captioning and language models in efficiently generating data for CIR only relying on unannotated image collections. Additionally, we introduce an embedding reformulation architecture that effectively combines image and text modalities. Our model, named InstructCIR, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot composed image retrieval on CIRR and FashionIQ datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by increasing the amount of generated data, our zero-shot model gets closer to the performance of supervised baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero Shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06602v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed image retrieval (CIR) allows a user to locate a target image by applying a fine-grained textual edit (e.g., ``turn the dress blue'' or ``remove stripes'') to a reference image. Zero-shot CIR, which embeds the image and the text with separate pretrained vision-language encoders, reaches only 20-25\% Recall@10 on the FashionIQ benchmark. We improve this by fine-tuning BLIP-2 with a lightweight Q-Former that fuses visual and textual features into a single embedding, raising Recall@10 to 45.6\% (shirt), 40.1\% (dress), and 50.4\% (top-tee) and increasing the average Recall@50 to 67.6\%. We also examine Retrieval-DPO, which fine-tunes CLIP's text encoder with a Direct Preference Optimization loss applied to FAISS-mined hard negatives. Despite extensive tuning of the scaling factor, index, and sampling strategy, Retrieval-DPO attains only 0.02\% Recall@10 -- far below zero-shot and prompt-tuned baselines -- because it (i) lacks joint image-text fusion, (ii) uses a margin objective misaligned with top-$K$ metrics, (iii) relies on low-quality negatives, and (iv) keeps the vision and Transformer layers frozen. Our results show that effective preference-based CIR requires genuine multimodal fusion, ranking-aware objectives, and carefully curated negatives.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

Existing methods in CIR struggle to accurately represent the image and the text modification, resulting in subpar performance. To address this limitation, we introduce a CIR framework, ConText-CIR, trained with a Text Concept-Consistency loss that encourages the representations of noun phrases in the text modification to better attend to the relevant parts of the query image. To support training with this loss function, we also propose a synthetic data generation pipeline that creates training data from existing CIR datasets or unlabeled images. We show that these components together enable stronger performance on CIR tasks, setting a new state-of-the-art in composed image retrieval in both the supervised and zero-shot settings on multiple benchmark datasets, including CIRR and CIRCO.

| **[Multimodal Reasoning Agent for Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19952v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve target images given a compositional query, consisting of a reference image and a modifying text-without relying on annotated training data. Existing approaches often generate a synthetic target text using large language models (LLMs) to serve as an intermediate anchor between the compositional query and the target image. Models are then trained to align the compositional query with the generated text, and separately align images with their corresponding texts using contrastive learning. However, this reliance on intermediate text introduces error propagation, as inaccuracies in query-to-text and text-to-image mappings accumulate, ultimately degrading retrieval performance. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework by employing a Multimodal Reasoning Agent (MRA) for ZS-CIR. MRA eliminates the dependence on textual intermediaries by directly constructing triplets, <reference image, modification text, target image>, using only unlabeled image data. By training on these synthetic triplets, our model learns to capture the relationships between compositional queries and candidate images directly. Extensive experiments on three standard CIR benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the FashionIQ dataset, our method improves Average R@10 by at least 7.5\% over existing baselines; on CIRR, it boosts R@1 by 9.6\%; and on CIRCO, it increases mAP@5 by 9.5\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[MLLM-Guided VLM Fine-Tuning with Joint Inference for Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19707v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) methods typically train adapters that convert reference images into pseudo-text tokens, which are concatenated with the modifying text and processed by frozen text encoders in pretrained VLMs or LLMs. While this design leverages the strengths of large pretrained models, it only supervises the adapter to produce encoder-compatible tokens that loosely preserve visual semantics. Crucially, it does not directly optimize the composed query representation to capture the full intent of the composition or to align with the target semantics, thereby limiting retrieval performance, particularly in cases involving fine-grained or complex visual transformations. To address this problem, we propose MLLM-Guided VLM Fine-Tuning with Joint Inference (MVFT-JI), a novel approach that leverages a pretrained multimodal large language model (MLLM) to construct two complementary training tasks using only unlabeled images: target text retrieval taskand text-to-image retrieval task. By jointly optimizing these tasks, our method enables the VLM to inherently acquire robust compositional retrieval capabilities, supported by the provided theoretical justifications and empirical validation. Furthermore, during inference, we further prompt the MLLM to generate target texts from composed queries and compute retrieval scores by integrating similarities between (i) the composed query and candidate images, and (ii) the MLLM-generated target text and candidate images. This strategy effectively combines the VLM's semantic alignment strengths with the MLLM's reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches focus on balancing global information from two modalities and encode the query into a unified feature for retrieval. However, due to insufficient attention to fine-grained details, these coarse fusion methods often struggle with handling subtle visual alterations or intricate textual instructions. In this work, we propose DetailFusion, a novel dual-branch framework that effectively coordinates information across global and detailed granularities, thereby enabling detail-enhanced CIR. Our approach leverages atomic detail variation priors derived from an image editing dataset, supplemented by a detail-oriented optimization strategy to develop a Detail-oriented Inference Branch. Furthermore, we design an Adaptive Feature Compositor that dynamically fuses global and detailed features based on fine-grained information of each unique multimodal query. Extensive experiments and ablation analyses not only demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CIRR and FashionIQ datasets but also validate the effectiveness and cross-domain adaptability of detail enhancement for CIR.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |

While recent CIR methods have shown promise, they mainly focus on exploring relationships between the query pairs (image and text) through data augmentation or model design. These methods often assume perfect alignment between queries and target images, an idealized scenario rarely encountered in practice. In reality, pairs are often partially or completely mismatched due to issues like inaccurate modification texts, low-quality target images, and annotation errors. Ignoring these mismatches leads to numerous False Positive Pair (FFPs) denoted as noise pairs in the dataset, causing the model to overfit and ultimately reducing its performance. To address this problem, we propose the Noise-aware Contrastive Learning for CIR (NCL-CIR), comprising two key components: the Weight Compensation Block (WCB) and the Noise-pair Filter Block (NFB). The WCB coupled with diverse weight maps can ensure more stable token representations of multi-modal queries and target images. Meanwhile, the NFB, in conjunction with the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) predicts noise pairs by evaluating loss distributions, and generates soft labels correspondingly, allowing for the design of the soft-label based Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) loss function. Consequently, the overall architecture helps to mitigate the influence of mismatched and partially matched samples, with experimental results demonstrating that NCL-CIR achieves exceptional performance on the benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Has b...</summary><p>Has been accepted by ICASSP2025</p></details> |
| **[From Mapping to Composing: A Two-Stage Framework for Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17990v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a challenging multimodal task that retrieves a target image based on a reference image and accompanying modification text. Due to the high cost of annotating CIR triplet datasets, zero-shot (ZS) CIR has gained traction as a promising alternative. Existing studies mainly focus on projection-based methods, which map an image to a single pseudo-word token. However, these methods face three critical challenges: (1) insufficient pseudo-word token representation capacity, (2) discrepancies between training and inference phases, and (3) reliance on large-scale synthetic data. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage framework where the training is accomplished from mapping to composing. In the first stage, we enhance image-to-pseudo-word token learning by introducing a visual semantic injection module and a soft text alignment objective, enabling the token to capture richer and fine-grained image information. In the second stage, we optimize the text encoder using a small amount of synthetic triplet data, enabling it to effectively extract compositional semantics by combining pseudo-word tokens with modification text for accurate target image retrieval. The strong visual-to-pseudo mapping established in the first stage provides a solid foundation for the second stage, making our approach compatible with both high- and low-quality synthetic data, and capable of achieving significant performance gains with only a small amount of synthetic data. Extensive experiments were conducted on three public datasets, achieving superior performance compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[TMCIR: Token Merge Benefits Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10995v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves target images using a multi-modal query that combines a reference image with text describing desired modifications. The primary challenge is effectively fusing this visual and textual information. Current cross-modal feature fusion approaches for CIR exhibit an inherent bias in intention interpretation. These methods tend to disproportionately emphasize either the reference image features (visual-dominant fusion) or the textual modification intent (text-dominant fusion through image-to-text conversion). Such an imbalanced representation often fails to accurately capture and reflect the actual search intent of the user in the retrieval results. To address this challenge, we propose TMCIR, a novel framework that advances composed image retrieval through two key innovations: 1) Intent-Aware Cross-Modal Alignment. We first fine-tune CLIP encoders contrastively using intent-reflecting pseudo-target images, synthesized from reference images and textual descriptions via a diffusion model. This step enhances the encoder ability of text to capture nuanced intents in textual descriptions. 2) Adaptive Token Fusion. We further fine-tune all encoders contrastively by comparing adaptive token-fusion features with the target image. This mechanism dynamically balances visual and textual representations within the contrastive learning pipeline, optimizing the composed feature for retrieval. Extensive experiments on Fashion-IQ and CIRR datasets demonstrate that TMCIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing nuanced user intent.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.05473 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Missing Target-Relevant Information Prediction with World Model for Accurate Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17109v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) involves diverse tasks with a broad range of visual content manipulation intent across domain, scene, object, and attribute. The key challenge for ZS-CIR tasks is to modify a reference image according to manipulation text to accurately retrieve a target image, especially when the reference image is missing essential target content. In this paper, we propose a novel prediction-based mapping network, named PrediCIR, to adaptively predict the missing target visual content in reference images in the latent space before mapping for accurate ZS-CIR. Specifically, a world view generation module first constructs a source view by omitting certain visual content of a target view, coupled with an action that includes the manipulation intent derived from existing image-caption pairs. Then, a target content prediction module trains a world model as a predictor to adaptively predict the missing visual information guided by user intention in manipulating text at the latent space. The two modules map an image with the predicted relevant information to a pseudo-word token without extra supervision. Our model shows strong generalization ability on six ZS-CIR tasks. It obtains consistent and significant performance boosts ranging from 1.73% to 4.45% over the best methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results on ZS-CIR.

Current ZS-CIR research mainly relies on the generalization ability of pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP. However, the pre-trained vision-language models and CIR tasks have substantial discrepancies, where the vision-language models focus on learning the similarities but CIR aims to learn the modifications of the image guided by text. In this paper, we introduce a novel unlabeled and pre-trained masked tuning approach, which reduces the gap between the pre-trained vision-language model and the downstream CIR task. First, to reduce the gap, we reformulate the contrastive learning of the vision-language model as the CIR task, where we randomly mask input image patches to generate $\langle$masked image, text, image$\rangle$ triplet from an image-text pair. Then, we propose a simple but novel pre-trained masked tuning method, which uses the text and the masked image to learn the modifications of the original image. With such a simple design, the proposed masked tuning can learn to better capture fine-grained text-guided modifications. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over the baseline models on four ZS-CIR datasets, including FashionIQ, CIRR, CIRCO, and GeneCIS.

The reference image defines the retrieval context, while the modification text specifies desired alterations. However, existing CIR datasets predominantly employ coarse-grained modification text (CoarseMT), which inadequately captures fine-grained retrieval intents. This limitation introduces two key challenges: (1) ignoring detailed differences leads to imprecise positive samples, and (2) greater ambiguity arises when retrieving visually similar images. These issues degrade retrieval accuracy, necessitating manual result filtering or repeated queries. To address these limitations, we develop a robust fine-grained CIR data annotation pipeline that minimizes imprecise positive samples and enhances CIR systems' ability to discern modification intents accurately. Using this pipeline, we refine the FashionIQ and CIRR datasets to create two fine-grained CIR datasets: Fine-FashionIQ and Fine-CIRR. Furthermore, we introduce FineCIR, the first CIR framework explicitly designed to parse the modification text. FineCIR effectively captures fine-grained modification semantics and aligns them with ambiguous visual entities, enhancing retrieval precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FineCIR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CIR baselines on both fine-grained and traditional CIR benchmark datasets. Our FineCIR code and fine-grained CIR datasets are available at https://github.com/SDU-L/FineCIR.git.</p></details> |  |

Typical training data consists of triplets containing a reference image, a textual description of desired modifications, and the target image, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. The scarcity of CIR datasets has led to zero-shot approaches utilizing synthetic triplets or leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) with ubiquitous web-crawled image-caption pairs. However, these methods have significant limitations: synthetic triplets suffer from limited scale, lack of diversity, and unnatural modification text, while image-caption pairs hinder joint embedding learning of the multimodal query due to the absence of triplet data. Moreover, existing approaches struggle with complex and nuanced modification texts that demand sophisticated fusion and understanding of vision and language modalities. We present CoLLM, a one-stop framework that effectively addresses these limitations. Our approach generates triplets on-the-fly from image-caption pairs, enabling supervised training without manual annotation. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate joint embeddings of reference images and modification texts, facilitating deeper multimodal fusion. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Text CIR (MTCIR), a large-scale dataset comprising 3.4M samples, and refine existing CIR benchmarks (CIRR and Fashion-IQ) to enhance evaluation reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that CoLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple CIR benchmarks and settings. MTCIR yields competitive results, with up to 15% performance improvement. Our refined benchmarks provide more reliable evaluation metrics for CIR models, contributing to the advancement of this important field.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Nevertheless, due to the expensive labor cost of training data annotation, recent researchers have shifted to the challenging task of zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR), which targets fulfilling CIR without annotated triplets. The pioneer ZS-CIR studies focus on converting the CIR task into a standard text-to-image retrieval task by pre-training a textual inversion network that can map a given image into a single pseudo-word token. Despite their significant progress, their coarse-grained textual inversion may be insufficient to capture the full content of the image accurately. To overcome this issue, in this work, we propose a novel Fine-grained Textual Inversion Network for ZS-CIR, named FTI4CIR. In particular, FTI4CIR comprises two main components: fine-grained pseudo-word token mapping and tri-wise caption-based semantic regularization. The former maps the image into a subject-oriented pseudo-word token and several attribute-oriented pseudo-word tokens to comprehensively express the image in the textual form, while the latter works on jointly aligning the fine-grained pseudo-word tokens to the real-word token embedding space based on a BLIP-generated image caption template. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in vision-language models have improved CIR, but dataset limitations remain a barrier. Existing datasets often rely on simplistic, ambiguous, or insufficient manual annotations, hindering fine-grained retrieval. We introduce good4cir, a structured pipeline leveraging vision-language models to generate high-quality synthetic annotations. Our method involves: (1) extracting fine-grained object descriptions from query images, (2) generating comparable descriptions for target images, and (3) synthesizing textual instructions capturing meaningful transformations between images. This reduces hallucination, enhances modification diversity, and ensures object-level consistency. Applying our method improves existing datasets and enables creating new datasets across diverse domains. Results demonstrate improved retrieval accuracy for CIR models trained on our pipeline-generated datasets.

| **[An Efficient Post-hoc Framework for Reducing Task Discrepancy of Text Encoders for Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09188v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve a target image based on a reference image and conditioning text, enabling controllable image searches. The mainstream Zero-Shot (ZS) CIR methods bypass the need for expensive training CIR triplets by projecting image embeddings into the text token embedding space, forming a composed query for retrieval. However, we highlight an inherent limitation in these projection-based CIR: a task discrepancy of text encoders between the original pre-training task of the encoders (text $\leftrightarrow$ image) and the target CIR task (image + text $\leftrightarrow$ image), which potentially negatively impacts CIR performance. To reduce such a discrepancy, a naive solution would be to train both image and text encoders with CIR triplets in a supervised manner. Instead, we introduce Reducing Task Discrepancy of Text Encoders (RTD), an efficient text-only post-hoc framework that complements projection-based CIR methods. We devise a novel target-anchored text contrastive learning designed to enhance the capability of the text encoder for CIR. We also propose two key enhancements: (1) a hard negative-based refined batch sampling strategy and (2) a refined concatenation scheme to further mitigate training-inference discrepancy. Integrating RTD into state-of-the-art projection-based methods achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, resource-intensive state-of-the-art synthetic CIR triplet-based approaches only with 23 minutes of additional training on 4 A100 GPUs (up to $100\times$ faster in training).

| **[Scale Efficient Training for Large Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13385v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of dataset scales has been a key driver in advancing deep learning research. However, as dataset scale increases, the training process becomes increasingly inefficient due to the presence of low-value samples, including excessive redundant samples, overly challenging samples, and inefficient easy samples that contribute little to model improvement.To address this challenge, we propose Scale Efficient Training (SeTa) for large datasets, a dynamic sample pruning approach that losslessly reduces training time. To remove low-value samples, SeTa first performs random pruning to eliminate redundant samples, then clusters the remaining samples according to their learning difficulty measured by loss. Building upon this clustering, a sliding window strategy is employed to progressively remove both overly challenging and inefficient easy clusters following an easy-to-hard curriculum.We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale synthetic datasets, including ToCa, SS1M, and ST+MJ, each containing over 3 million samples.SeTa reduces training costs by up to 50\% while maintaining or improving performance, with minimal degradation even at 70\% cost reduction. Furthermore, experiments on various scale real datasets across various backbones (CNNs, Transformers, and Mambas) and diverse tasks (instruction tuning, multi-view stereo, geo-localization, composed image retrieval, referring image segmentation) demonstrate the powerful effectiveness and universality of our approach.

| **[Data-Efficient Generalization for Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05204v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve the target image based on a reference image and a text description without requiring in-distribution triplets for training. One prevalent approach follows the vision-language pretraining paradigm that employs a mapping network to transfer the image embedding to a pseudo-word token in the text embedding space. However, this approach tends to impede network generalization due to modality discrepancy and distribution shift between training and inference. To this end, we propose a Data-efficient Generalization (DeG) framework, including two novel designs, namely, Textual Supplement (TS) module and Semantic-Set (S-Set). The TS module exploits compositional textual semantics during training, enhancing the pseudo-word token with more linguistic semantics and thus mitigating the modality discrepancy effectively. The S-Set exploits the zero-shot capability of pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), alleviating the distribution shift and mitigating the overfitting issue from the redundancy of the large-scale image-text data. Extensive experiments over four ZS-CIR benchmarks show that DeG outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with much less training data, and saves substantial training and inference time for practical usage.</p></details> |  |

To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no comprehensive review of CIR to provide a timely overview of this field. Therefore, we synthesize insights from over 120 publications in top conferences and journals, including ACM TOIS, SIGIR, and CVPR In particular, we systematically categorize existing supervised CIR and zero-shot CIR models using a fine-grained taxonomy. For a comprehensive review, we also briefly discuss approaches for tasks closely related to CIR, such as attribute-based CIR and dialog-based CIR. Additionally, we summarize benchmark datasets for evaluation and analyze existing supervised and zero-shot CIR methods by comparing experimental results across multiple datasets.

Existing methods primarily combine caption models and large language models (LLMs) to generate target captions based on composed queries but face various issues such as incompatibility, visual information loss, and insufficient reasoning. In this work, we propose CoTMR, a training-free framework crafted for ZS-CIR with novel Chain-of-thought (CoT) and Multi-scale Reasoning. Instead of relying on caption models for modality transformation, CoTMR employs the Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to achieve unified understanding and reasoning for composed queries. To enhance the reasoning reliability, we devise CIRCoT, which guides the LVLM through a step-by-step inference process using predefined subtasks. Considering that existing approaches focus solely on global-level reasoning, our CoTMR incorporates multi-scale reasoning to achieve more comprehensive inference via fine-grained predictions about the presence or absence of key elements at the object scale. Further, we design a Multi-Grained Scoring (MGS) mechanism, which integrates CLIP similarity scores of the above reasoning outputs with candidate images to realize precise retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CoTMR not only drastically outperforms previous methods across four prominent benchmarks but also offers appealing interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scale Up Composed Image Retrieval Learning via Modification Text Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05316v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to search an image of interest using a combination of a reference image and modification text as the query. Despite recent advancements, this task remains challenging due to limited training data and laborious triplet annotation processes. To address this issue, this paper proposes to synthesize the training triplets to augment the training resource for the CIR problem. Specifically, we commence by training a modification text generator exploiting large-scale multimodal models and scale up the CIR learning throughout both the pretraining and fine-tuning stages. During pretraining, we leverage the trained generator to directly create Modification Text-oriented Synthetic Triplets(MTST) conditioned on pairs of images. For fine-tuning, we first synthesize reverse modification text to connect the target image back to the reference image. Subsequently, we devise a two-hop alignment strategy to incrementally close the semantic gap between the multimodal pair and the target image. We initially learn an implicit prototype utilizing both the original triplet and its reversed version in a cycle manner, followed by combining the implicit prototype feature with the modification text to facilitate accurate alignment with the target image. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of the generated triplets and confirm that our proposed methodology attains competitive recall on both the CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Triplet Synthesis For Enhancing Composed Image Retrieval via Counterfactual Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13968v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) provides an effective way to manage and access large-scale visual data. Construction of the CIR model utilizes triplets that consist of a reference image, modification text describing desired changes, and a target image that reflects these changes. For effectively training CIR models, extensive manual annotation to construct high-quality training datasets, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, is required. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a novel triplet synthesis method by leveraging counterfactual image generation. By controlling visual feature modifications via counterfactual image generation, our approach automatically generates diverse training triplets without any manual intervention. This approach facilitates the creation of larger and more expressive datasets, leading to the improvement of CIR model's performance.</p></details> | 4 pages, 4 figures |

Existing training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) methods often employ a two-stage process: they first generate a caption for the reference image and then use Large Language Models for reasoning to obtain a target description. However, these methods suffer from missing critical visual details and limited reasoning capabilities, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel, training-free one-stage method, One-Stage Reflective Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for ZS-CIR (OSrCIR), which employs Multimodal Large Language Models to retain essential visual information in a single-stage reasoning process, eliminating the information loss seen in two-stage methods. Our Reflective Chain-of-Thought framework further improves interpretative accuracy by aligning manipulation intent with contextual cues from reference images. OSrCIR achieves performance gains of 1.80% to 6.44% over existing training-free methods across multiple tasks, setting new state-of-the-art results in ZS-CIR and enhancing its utility in vision-language applications.

| **[MegaPairs: Massive Data Synthesis For Universal Multimodal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14475v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapidly growing demand for multimodal retrieval, progress in this field remains severely constrained by a lack of training data. In this paper, we introduce MegaPairs, a novel data synthesis method that leverages vision language models (VLMs) and open-domain images, together with a massive synthetic dataset generated from this method. Our empirical analysis shows that MegaPairs generates high-quality data, enabling the multimodal retriever to significantly outperform the baseline model trained on 70$\times$ more data from existing datasets. Moreover, since MegaPairs solely relies on general image corpora and open-source VLMs, it can be easily scaled up, enabling continuous improvements in retrieval performance. In this stage, we produced more than 26 million training instances and trained several models of varying sizes using this data. These new models achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across 4 popular composed image retrieval (CIR) benchmarks and the highest overall performance on the 36 datasets provided by MMEB. They also demonstrate notable performance improvements with additional downstream fine-tuning. Our produced dataset, well-trained models, and data synthesis pipeline will be made publicly available to facilitate the future development of this field.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies attempt to utilize Vision-Language Pre-training Models (VLPMs) with various fusion strategies for addressing the task.However, these methods typically fail to simultaneously meet two key requirements of CIR: comprehensively extracting visual information and faithfully following the user intent. In this work, we propose CIR-LVLM, a novel framework that leverages the large vision-language model (LVLM) as the powerful user intent-aware encoder to better meet these requirements. Our motivation is to explore the advanced reasoning and instruction-following capabilities of LVLM for accurately understanding and responding the user intent. Furthermore, we design a novel hybrid intent instruction module to provide explicit intent guidance at two levels: (1) The task prompt clarifies the task requirement and assists the model in discerning user intent at the task level. (2) The instance-specific soft prompt, which is adaptively selected from the learnable prompt pool, enables the model to better comprehend the user intent at the instance level compared to a universal prompt for all instances. CIR-LVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three prominent benchmarks with acceptable inference efficiency. We believe this study provides fundamental insights into CIR-related fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Compositional Image Retrieval via Instruction-Aware Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05756v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) involves retrieving a target image based on a composed query of an image paired with text that specifies modifications or changes to the visual reference. CIR is inherently an instruction-following task, as the model needs to interpret and apply modifications to the image. In practice, due to the scarcity of annotated data in downstream tasks, Zero-Shot CIR (ZS-CIR) is desirable. While existing ZS-CIR models based on CLIP have shown promising results, their capability in interpreting and following modification instructions remains limited. Some research attempts to address this by incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these approaches still face challenges in effectively integrating multimodal information and instruction understanding. To tackle above challenges, we propose a novel embedding method utilizing an instruction-tuned Multimodal LLM (MLLM) to generate composed representation, which significantly enhance the instruction following capability for a comprehensive integration between images and instructions. Nevertheless, directly applying MLLMs introduces a new challenge since MLLMs are primarily designed for text generation rather than embedding extraction as required in CIR. To address this, we introduce a two-stage training strategy to efficiently learn a joint multimodal embedding space and further refining the ability to follow modification instructions by tuning the model in a triplet dataset similar to the CIR format. Extensive experiments on four public datasets: FashionIQ, CIRR, GeneCIS, and CIRCO demonstrates the superior performance of our model, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin.

We show that a strong vision-language model provides sufficient descriptive power without additional training. The query image is mapped to the text input space using textual inversion. Unlike common practice that invert in the continuous space of text tokens, we use the discrete word space via a nearest-neighbor search in a text vocabulary. With this inversion, the image is softly mapped across the vocabulary and is made more robust using retrieval-based augmentation. Database images are retrieved by a weighted ensemble of text queries combining mapped words with the domain text. Our method outperforms prior art by a large margin on standard and newly introduced benchmarks. Code: https://github.com/NikosEfth/freedom</p></details> | WACV 2025 |
| **[Imagine and Seek: Improving Composed Image Retrieval with an Imagined Proxy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16752v2)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZSCIR) requires retrieving images that match the query image and the relative captions. Current methods focus on projecting the query image into the text feature space, subsequently combining them with features of query texts for retrieval. However, retrieving images only with the text features cannot guarantee detailed alignment due to the natural gap between images and text. In this paper, we introduce Imagined Proxy for CIR (IP-CIR), a training-free method that creates a proxy image aligned with the query image and text description, enhancing query representation in the retrieval process. We first leverage the large language model's generalization capability to generate an image layout, and then apply both the query text and image for conditional generation. The robust query features are enhanced by merging the proxy image, query image, and text semantic perturbation. Our newly proposed balancing metric integrates text-based and proxy retrieval similarities, allowing for more accurate retrieval of the target image while incorporating image-side information into the process. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves retrieval performances. We achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the CIRR dataset with a Recall@K of 70.07 at K=10. Additionally, we achieved an improvement in Recall@10 on the FashionIQ dataset, rising from 45.11 to 45.74, and improved the baseline performance in CIRCO with a mAPK@10 score, increasing from 32.24 to 34.26.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, the synthetic framework is usually designed with meticulous human effort for each task due to various requirements on image layout, content, and annotation formats, restricting the application of synthetic data on more general scenarios. In this paper, we propose AnySynth, a unified framework integrating adaptable, comprehensive, and highly controllable components capable of generating an arbitrary type of synthetic data given diverse requirements. Specifically, the Task-Specific Layout Generation Module is first introduced to produce reasonable layouts for different tasks by leveraging the generation ability of large language models and layout priors of real-world images. A Uni-Controlled Image Generation Module is then developed to create high-quality synthetic images that are controllable and based on the generated layouts. In addition, user specific reference images, and style images can be incorporated into the generation to task requirements. Finally, the Task-Oriented Annotation Module offers precise and detailed annotations for the generated images across different tasks. We have validated our framework's performance across various tasks, including Few-shot Object Detection, Cross-domain Object Detection, Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval, and Multi-modal Image Perception and Grounding. The specific data synthesized by our framework significantly improves model performance in these tasks, demonstrating the generality and effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Training Boosted Multi-Factor Matching Network for Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09979v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The composed image retrieval (CIR) task aims to retrieve the desired target image for a given multimodal query, i.e., a reference image with its corresponding modification text. The key limitations encountered by existing efforts are two aspects: 1) ignoring the multi-faceted query-target matching factors; 2) ignoring the potential unlabeled reference-target image pairs in existing benchmark datasets. To address these two limitations is non-trivial due to the following challenges: 1) how to effectively model the multi-faceted matching factors in a latent way without direct supervision signals; 2) how to fully utilize the potential unlabeled reference-target image pairs to improve the generalization ability of the CIR model. To address these challenges, in this work, we first propose a muLtI-faceted Matching Network (LIMN), which consists of three key modules: multi-grained image/text encoder, latent factor-oriented feature aggregation, and query-target matching modeling. Thereafter, we design an iterative dual self-training paradigm to further enhance the performance of LIMN by fully utilizing the potential unlabeled reference-target image pairs in a semi-supervised manner. Specifically, we denote the iterative dual self-training paradigm enhanced LIMN as LIMN+. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, FashionIQ, Shoes, and Birds-to-Words, show that our proposed method significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

As previous supervised or zero-shot learning paradigms all fail to strike a good trade-off between the model's generalization ability and retrieval performance, recent researchers have introduced the task of few-shot CIR (FS-CIR) and proposed a textual inversion-based network based on pretrained CLIP model to realize it. Despite its promising performance, the approach encounters two key limitations: simply relying on the few annotated samples for CIR model training and indiscriminately selecting training triplets for CIR model fine-tuning. To address these two limitations, we propose a novel two-stage pseudo triplet guided few-shot CIR scheme, dubbed PTG-FSCIR. In the first stage, we propose an attentive masking and captioning-based pseudo triplet generation method, to construct pseudo triplets from pure image data and use them to fulfill the CIR-task specific pertaining. In the second stage, we propose a challenging triplet-based CIR fine-tuning method, where we design a pseudo modification text-based sample challenging score estimation strategy and a robust top range-based random sampling strategy for sampling robust challenging triplets to promote the model fine-tuning. Notably, our scheme is plug-and-play and compatible with any existing supervised CIR models. We test our scheme across two backbones on three public datasets (i.e., FashionIQ, CIRR, and Birds-to-Words), achieving maximum improvements of 13.3%, 22.2%, and 17.4% respectively, demonstrating our scheme's efficacy.</p></details> | 10pages |

However, training a CIR model in a supervised manner typically requires labor-intensive collection of (reference image, text modifier, target image) triplets. While existing zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) methods eliminate the need for training on specific downstream datasets, they still require additional pretraining on large-scale image datasets. In this paper, we introduce a training-free approach for ZS-CIR. Our approach, Weighted Modality fusion and similarity for CIR (WeiMoCIR), operates under the assumption that image and text modalities can be effectively combined using a simple weighted average. This allows the query representation to be constructed directly from the reference image and text modifier. To further enhance retrieval performance, we employ multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate image captions for the database images and incorporate these textual captions into the similarity computation by combining them with image information using a weighted average. Our approach is simple, easy to implement, and its effectiveness is validated through experiments on the FashionIQ and CIRR datasets.

| **[CoVR-2: Automatic Data Construction for Composed Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14746v4)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CoIR) has recently gained popularity as a task that considers both text and image queries together, to search for relevant images in a database. Most CoIR approaches require manually annotated datasets, comprising image-text-image triplets, where the text describes a modification from the query image to the target image. However, manual curation of CoIR triplets is expensive and prevents scalability. In this work, we instead propose a scalable automatic dataset creation methodology that generates triplets given video-caption pairs, while also expanding the scope of the task to include composed video retrieval (CoVR). To this end, we mine paired videos with a similar caption from a large database, and leverage a large language model to generate the corresponding modification text. Applying this methodology to the extensive WebVid2M collection, we automatically construct our WebVid-CoVR dataset, resulting in 1.6 million triplets. Moreover, we introduce a new benchmark for CoVR with a manually annotated evaluation set, along with baseline results. We further validate that our methodology is equally applicable to image-caption pairs, by generating 3.3 million CoIR training triplets using the Conceptual Captions dataset. Our model builds on BLIP-2 pretraining, adapting it to composed video (or image) retrieval, and incorporates an additional caption retrieval loss to exploit extra supervision beyond the triplet. We provide extensive ablations to analyze the design choices on our new CoVR benchmark. Our experiments also demonstrate that training a CoVR model on our datasets effectively transfers to CoIR, leading to improved state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot setup on the CIRR, FashionIQ, and CIRCO benchmarks.

| **[Denoise-I2W: Mapping Images to Denoising Words for Accurate Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17393v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) supports diverse tasks with a broad range of visual content manipulation intentions that can be related to domain, scene, object, and attribute. A key challenge for ZS-CIR is to accurately map image representation to a pseudo-word token that captures the manipulation intention relevant image information for generalized CIR. However, existing methods between the retrieval and pre-training stages lead to significant redundancy in the pseudo-word tokens. In this paper, we propose a novel denoising image-to-word mapping approach, named Denoise-I2W, for mapping images into denoising pseudo-word tokens that, without intention-irrelevant visual information, enhance accurate ZS-CIR. Specifically, a pseudo triplet construction module first automatically constructs pseudo triples (\textit{i.e.,} a pseudo-reference image, a pseudo-manipulation text, and a target image) for pre-training the denoising mapping network. Then, a pseudo-composed mapping module maps the pseudo-reference image to a pseudo-word token and combines it with the pseudo-manipulation text with manipulation intention. This combination aligns with the target image, facilitating denoising intention-irrelevant visual information for mapping. Our proposed Denoise-I2W is a model-agnostic and annotation-free approach. It demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across three state-of-the-art ZS-CIR models on four benchmark datasets. By integrating Denoise-I2W with existing best models, we obtain consistent and significant performance boosts ranging from 1.45\% to 4.17\% over the best methods without increasing inference costs. and achieve new state-of-the-art results on ZS-CIR.

A key challenge is top-bottom retrieval, where precise compatibility modeling is essential. Traditional methods, often based on Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), have shown limited performance. Recent efforts have explored using generative models in compatibility modeling and item retrieval, where generated images serve as additional inputs. However, these approaches often overlook the quality of generated images, which could be crucial for model performance. Additionally, generative models typically require large datasets, posing challenges when such data is scarce. To address these issues, we introduce the Generative Compatibility Model (GeCo), a two-stage approach that improves fashion image retrieval through paired image-to-image translation. First, the Complementary Item Generation Model (CIGM), built on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), generates target item images (e.g., bottoms) from seed items (e.g., tops), offering conditioning signals for retrieval. These generated samples are then integrated into GeCo, enhancing compatibility modeling and retrieval accuracy. Evaluations on three datasets show that GeCo outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Key contributions include: (i) the GeCo model utilizing paired image-to-image translation within the Composed Image Retrieval framework, (ii) comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, and (iii) the release of a new Fashion Taobao dataset designed for top-bottom retrieval, promoting further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Group: Composed Image Retrieval via Consensus Learning from Noisy Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02092v2)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed image retrieval extends content-based image retrieval systems by enabling users to search using reference images and captions that describe their intention. Despite great progress in developing image-text compositors to extract discriminative visual-linguistic features, we identify a hitherto overlooked issue, triplet ambiguity, which impedes robust feature extraction. Triplet ambiguity refers to a type of semantic ambiguity that arises between the reference image, the relative caption, and the target image. It is mainly due to the limited representation of the annotated text, resulting in many noisy triplets where multiple visually dissimilar candidate images can be matched to an identical reference pair (i.e., a reference image + a relative caption). To address this challenge, we propose the Consensus Network (Css-Net), inspired by the psychological concept that groups outperform individuals. Css-Net comprises two core components: (1) a consensus module with four diverse compositors, each generating distinct image-text embeddings, fostering complementary feature extraction and mitigating dependence on any single, potentially biased compositor; (2) a Kullback-Leibler divergence loss that encourages learning of inter-compositor interactions to promote consensual outputs. During evaluation, the decisions of the four compositors are combined through a weighting scheme, enhancing overall agreement. On benchmark datasets, particularly FashionIQ, Css-Net demonstrates marked improvements. Notably, it achieves significant recall gains, with a 2.77% increase in R@10 and 6.67% boost in R@50, underscoring its competitiveness in addressing the fundamental limitations of existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS)</p></details> |

Advanced methods often utilize contrastive learning as the optimization objective, which benefits from adequate positive and negative examples. However, the triplet for CIR incurs high manual annotation costs, resulting in limited positive examples. Furthermore, existing methods commonly use in-batch negative sampling, which reduces the negative number available for the model. To address the problem of lack of positives, we propose a data generation method by leveraging a multi-modal large language model to construct triplets for CIR. To introduce more negatives during fine-tuning, we design a two-stage fine-tuning framework for CIR, whose second stage introduces plenty of static representations of negatives to optimize the representation space rapidly. The above two improvements can be effectively stacked and designed to be plug-and-play, easily applied to existing CIR models without changing their original architectures. Extensive experiments and ablation analysis demonstrate that our method effectively scales positives and negatives and achieves state-of-the-art results on both FashionIQ and CIRR datasets. In addition, our method also performs well in zero-shot composed image retrieval, providing a new CIR solution for the low-resources scenario.

Current Zero-Shot CIR (ZS-CIR) methods try to solve CIR tasks without using expensive triplet-labeled training datasets. However, the gap between ZS-CIR and triplet-supervised CIR is still large. In this work, we propose Hybrid CIR (HyCIR), which uses synthetic labels to boost the performance of ZS-CIR. A new label Synthesis pipeline for CIR (SynCir) is proposed, in which only unlabeled images are required. First, image pairs are extracted based on visual similarity. Second, query text is generated for each image pair based on vision-language model and LLM. Third, the data is further filtered in language space based on semantic similarity. To improve ZS-CIR performance, we propose a hybrid training strategy to work with both ZS-CIR supervision and synthetic CIR triplets. Two kinds of contrastive learning are adopted. One is to use large-scale unlabeled image dataset to learn an image-to-text mapping with good generalization. The other is to use synthetic CIR triplets to learn a better mapping for CIR tasks. Our approach achieves SOTA zero-shot performance on the common CIR benchmarks: CIRR and CIRCO.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval Considering Query-target Relationship Leveraging Masked Image-text Pairs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18836v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel zero-shot composed image retrieval (CIR) method considering the query-target relationship by masked image-text pairs. The objective of CIR is to retrieve the target image using a query image and a query text. Existing methods use a textual inversion network to convert the query image into a pseudo word to compose the image and text and use a pre-trained visual-language model to realize the retrieval. However, they do not consider the query-target relationship to train the textual inversion network to acquire information for retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot CIR method that is trained end-to-end using masked image-text pairs. By exploiting the abundant image-text pairs that are convenient to obtain with a masking strategy for learning the query-target relationship, it is expected that accurate zero-shot CIR using a retrieval-focused textual inversion network can be realized. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper in IEEE ICIP 2024</p></details> |

While current methods treat this as a query-target matching problem, we argue that CIR triplets contain additional associations beyond this primary relation. In our paper, we identify two new relations within triplets, treating each triplet as a graph node. Firstly, we introduce the concept of text-bridged image alignment, where the query text serves as a bridge between the query image and the target image. We propose a hinge-based cross-attention mechanism to incorporate this relation into network learning. Secondly, we explore complementary text reasoning, considering CIR as a form of cross-modal retrieval where two images compose to reason about complementary text. To integrate these perspectives effectively, we design a twin attention-based compositor. By combining these complementary associations with the explicit query pair-target image relation, we establish a comprehensive set of constraints for CIR. Our framework, CaLa (Complementary Association Learning for Augmenting Composed Image Retrieval), leverages these insights. We evaluate CaLa on CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks with multiple backbones, demonstrating its superiority in composed image retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at SIGIR 2024. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2309.02169</p></details> |
| **[Spherical Linear Interpolation and Text-Anchoring for Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00571v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a complex task that retrieves images using a query, which is configured with an image and a caption that describes desired modifications to that image. Supervised CIR approaches have shown strong performance, but their reliance on expensive manually-annotated datasets restricts their scalability and broader applicability. To address these issues, previous studies have proposed pseudo-word token-based Zero-Shot CIR (ZS-CIR) methods, which utilize a projection module to map images to word tokens. However, we conjecture that this approach has a downside: the projection module distorts the original image representation and confines the resulting composed embeddings to the text-side. In order to resolve this, we introduce a novel ZS-CIR method that uses Spherical Linear Interpolation (Slerp) to directly merge image and text representations by identifying an intermediate embedding of both. Furthermore, we introduce Text-Anchored-Tuning (TAT), a method that fine-tunes the image encoder while keeping the text encoder fixed. TAT closes the modality gap between images and text, making the Slerp process much more effective. Notably, the TAT method is not only efficient in terms of the scale of the training dataset and training time, but it also serves as an excellent initial checkpoint for training supervised CIR models, thereby highlighting its wider potential. The integration of the Slerp-based ZS-CIR with a TAT-tuned model enables our approach to deliver state-of-the-art retrieval performance across CIR benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple but Effective Raw-Data Level Multimodal Fusion for Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15875v1)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed image retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve the target image based on a multimodal query, i.e., a reference image paired with corresponding modification text. Recent CIR studies leverage vision-language pre-trained (VLP) methods as the feature extraction backbone, and perform nonlinear feature-level multimodal query fusion to retrieve the target image. Despite the promising performance, we argue that their nonlinear feature-level multimodal fusion may lead to the fused feature deviating from the original embedding space, potentially hurting the retrieval performance. To address this issue, in this work, we propose shifting the multimodal fusion from the feature level to the raw-data level to fully exploit the VLP model's multimodal encoding and cross-modal alignment abilities. In particular, we introduce a Dual Query Unification-based Composed Image Retrieval framework (DQU-CIR), whose backbone simply involves a VLP model's image encoder and a text encoder. Specifically, DQU-CIR first employs two training-free query unification components: text-oriented query unification and vision-oriented query unification, to derive a unified textual and visual query based on the raw data of the multimodal query, respectively. The unified textual query is derived by concatenating the modification text with the extracted reference image's textual description, while the unified visual query is created by writing the key modification words onto the reference image. Ultimately, to address diverse search intentions, DQU-CIR linearly combines the features of the two unified queries encoded by the VLP model to retrieve the target image. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | ACM SIGIR 2024 |
| **[Visual Delta Generator with Large Multi-modal Models for Semi-supervised Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15516v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a task that retrieves images similar to a query, based on a provided textual modification. Current techniques rely on supervised learning for CIR models using labeled triplets of the reference image, text, target image. These specific triplets are not as commonly available as simple image-text pairs, limiting the widespread use of CIR and its scalability. On the other hand, zero-shot CIR can be relatively easily trained with image-caption pairs without considering the image-to-image relation, but this approach tends to yield lower accuracy. We propose a new semi-supervised CIR approach where we search for a reference and its related target images in auxiliary data and learn our large language model-based Visual Delta Generator (VDG) to generate text describing the visual difference (i.e., visual delta) between the two. VDG, equipped with fluent language knowledge and being model agnostic, can generate pseudo triplets to boost the performance of CIR models. Our approach significantly improves the existing supervised learning approaches and achieves state-of-the-art results on the CIR benchmarks.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Conventional CIR approaches need a training dataset composed of triplets of query image, query text, and target image, which is very expensive to collect. Several recent works have worked on the zero-shot (ZS) CIR paradigm to tackle the issue without using pre-collected triplets. However, the existing ZS-CIR methods show limited backbone scalability and generalizability due to the lack of diversity of the input texts during training. We propose a novel CIR framework, only using language for its training. Our LinCIR (Language-only training for CIR) can be trained only with text datasets by a novel self-supervision named self-masking projection (SMP). We project the text latent embedding to the token embedding space and construct a new text by replacing the keyword tokens of the original text. Then, we let the new and original texts have the same latent embedding vector. With this simple strategy, LinCIR is surprisingly efficient and highly effective; LinCIR with CLIP ViT-G backbone is trained in 48 minutes and shows the best ZS-CIR performances on four different CIR benchmarks, CIRCO, GeneCIS, FashionIQ, and CIRR, even outperforming supervised method on FashionIQ.

| **[Training-free Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval with Local Concept Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08924v2)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed image retrieval attempts to retrieve an image of interest from gallery images through a composed query of a reference image and its corresponding modified text. It has recently attracted attention due to the collaboration of information-rich images and concise language to precisely express the requirements of target images. Most current composed image retrieval methods follow a supervised learning approach to training on a costly triplet dataset composed of a reference image, modified text, and a corresponding target image. To avoid difficult to-obtain labeled triplet training data, zero-shot composed image retrieval (ZS-CIR) has been introduced, which aims to retrieve the target image by learning from image-text pairs (self-supervised triplets), without the need for human-labeled triplets. However, this self-supervised triplet learning approach is computationally less effective and less understandable as it assumes the interaction between image and text is conducted with implicit query embedding without explicit semantical interpretation. In this work, we present a new training-free zero-shot composed image retrieval method which translates the query into explicit human-understandable text. This helps improve model learning efficiency to enhance the generalization capacity of foundation models. Further, we introduce a Local Concept Re-ranking (LCR) mechanism to focus on discriminative local information extracted from the modified instructions. Extensive experiments on four ZS-CIR benchmarks show that our method achieves comparable performances to that of the state of-the-art triplet training based methods, but significantly outperforms other training-free methods on the open domain datasets (CIRR, CIRCO and COCO), as well as the fashion domain dataset (FashionIQ).</p></details> | Under Review |

Previous works generate pseudo-word tokens by projecting the reference image features to the text embedding space. However, they focus on the global visual representation, ignoring the representation of detailed attributes, e.g., color, object number and layout. To address this challenge, we propose a Knowledge-Enhanced Dual-stream zero-shot composed image retrieval framework (KEDs). KEDs implicitly models the attributes of the reference images by incorporating a database. The database enriches the pseudo-word tokens by providing relevant images and captions, emphasizing shared attribute information in various aspects. In this way, KEDs recognizes the reference image from diverse perspectives. Moreover, KEDs adopts an extra stream that aligns pseudo-word tokens with textual concepts, leveraging pseudo-triplets mined from image-text pairs. The pseudo-word tokens generated in this stream are explicitly aligned with fine-grained semantics in the text embedding space. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks, i.e. ImageNet-R, COCO object, Fashion-IQ and CIRR, show that KEDs outperforms previous zero-shot composed image retrieval methods.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |

While text is widely used for inter-category retrieval tasks, sketches have been established as the sole preferred modality for fine-grained image retrieval due to their ability to capture intricate visual details. In this paper, we question the reliance on sketches alone for fine-grained image retrieval by simultaneously exploring the fine-grained representation capabilities of both sketch and text, orchestrating a duet between the two. The end result enables precise retrievals previously unattainable, allowing users to pose ever-finer queries and incorporate attributes like colour and contextual cues from text. For this purpose, we introduce a novel compositionality framework, effectively combining sketches and text using pre-trained CLIP models, while eliminating the need for extensive fine-grained textual descriptions. Last but not least, our system extends to novel applications in composed image retrieval, domain attribute transfer, and fine-grained generation, providing solutions for various real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2024.

We make the following contributions: (i) we initiate a scalable pipeline to automatically construct datasets for training CIR model, by simply exploiting a large-scale dataset of image-text pairs, e.g., a subset of LAION-5B; (ii) we introduce a transformer-based adaptive aggregation model, TransAgg, which employs a simple yet efficient fusion mechanism, to adaptively combine information from diverse modalities; (iii) we conduct extensive ablation studies to investigate the usefulness of our proposed data construction procedure, and the effectiveness of core components in TransAgg; (iv) when evaluating on the publicly available benckmarks under the zero-shot scenario, i.e., training on the automatically constructed datasets, then directly conduct inference on target downstream datasets, e.g., CIRR and FashionIQ, our proposed approach either performs on par with or significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

| **[Image2Sentence based Asymmetrical Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01431v1)** | 2024-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of composed image retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve images based on the query image and the text describing the users' intent. Existing methods have made great progress with the advanced large vision-language (VL) model in CIR task, however, they generally suffer from two main issues: lack of labeled triplets for model training and difficulty of deployment on resource-restricted environments when deploying the large vision-language model. To tackle the above problems, we propose Image2Sentence based Asymmetric zero-shot composed image retrieval (ISA), which takes advantage of the VL model and only relies on unlabeled images for composition learning. In the framework, we propose a new adaptive token learner that maps an image to a sentence in the word embedding space of VL model. The sentence adaptively captures discriminative visual information and is further integrated with the text modifier. An asymmetric structure is devised for flexible deployment, in which the lightweight model is adopted for the query side while the large VL model is deployed on the gallery side. The global contrastive distillation and the local alignment regularization are adopted for the alignment between the light model and the VL model for CIR task. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed ISA could better cope with the real retrieval scenarios and further improve retrieval accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 spotlight |
| **[Dual Relation Alignment for Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02169v3)** | 2024-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed image retrieval, a task involving the search for a target image using a reference image and a complementary text as the query, has witnessed significant advancements owing to the progress made in cross-modal modeling. Unlike the general image-text retrieval problem with only one alignment relation, i.e., image-text, we argue for the existence of two types of relations in composed image retrieval. The explicit relation pertains to the reference image & complementary text-target image, which is commonly exploited by existing methods. Besides this intuitive relation, the observations during our practice have uncovered another implicit yet crucial relation, i.e., reference image & target image-complementary text, since we found that the complementary text can be inferred by studying the relation between the target image and the reference image. Regrettably, existing methods largely focus on leveraging the explicit relation to learn their networks, while overlooking the implicit relation. In response to this weakness, We propose a new framework for composed image retrieval, termed dual relation alignment, which integrates both explicit and implicit relations to fully exploit the correlations among the triplets. Specifically, we design a vision compositor to fuse reference image and target image at first, then the resulted representation will serve two roles: (1) counterpart for semantic alignment with the complementary text and (2) compensation for the complementary text to boost the explicit relation modeling, thereby implant the implicit relation into the alignment learning. Our method is evaluated on two popular datasets, CIRR and FashionIQ, through extensive experiments. The results confirm the effectiveness of our dual-relation learning in substantially enhancing composed image retrieval performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The architecture of our model changes, hence methodolgy and experiments changes a lot, We have significantly revised the original manuscript of the paper, so a withdraw of our original script is needed</p></details> |
| **[Composed Image Retrieval with Text Feedback via Multi-grained Uncertainty Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07394v6)** | 2024-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate composed image retrieval with text feedback. Users gradually look for the target of interest by moving from coarse to fine-grained feedback. However, existing methods merely focus on the latter, i.e., fine-grained search, by harnessing positive and negative pairs during training. This pair-based paradigm only considers the one-to-one distance between a pair of specific points, which is not aligned with the one-to-many coarse-grained retrieval process and compromises the recall rate. In an attempt to fill this gap, we introduce a unified learning approach to simultaneously modeling the coarse- and fine-grained retrieval by considering the multi-grained uncertainty. The key idea underpinning the proposed method is to integrate fine- and coarse-grained retrieval as matching data points with small and large fluctuations, respectively. Specifically, our method contains two modules: uncertainty modeling and uncertainty regularization. (1) The uncertainty modeling simulates the multi-grained queries by introducing identically distributed fluctuations in the feature space. (2) Based on the uncertainty modeling, we further introduce uncertainty regularization to adapt the matching objective according to the fluctuation range. Compared with existing methods, the proposed strategy explicitly prevents the model from pushing away potential candidates in the early stage, and thus improves the recall rate. On the three public datasets, i.e., FashionIQ, Fashion200k, and Shoes, the proposed method has achieved +4.03%, +3.38%, and +2.40% Recall@50 accuracy over a strong baseline, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Candidate Set Re-ranking for Composed Image Retrieval with Dual Multi-modal Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16304v3)** | 2024-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed image retrieval aims to find an image that best matches a given multi-modal user query consisting of a reference image and text pair. Existing methods commonly pre-compute image embeddings over the entire corpus and compare these to a reference image embedding modified by the query text at test time. Such a pipeline is very efficient at test time since fast vector distances can be used to evaluate candidates, but modifying the reference image embedding guided only by a short textual description can be difficult, especially independent of potential candidates. An alternative approach is to allow interactions between the query and every possible candidate, i.e., reference-text-candidate triplets, and pick the best from the entire set. Though this approach is more discriminative, for large-scale datasets the computational cost is prohibitive since pre-computation of candidate embeddings is no longer possible. We propose to combine the merits of both schemes using a two-stage model. Our first stage adopts the conventional vector distancing metric and performs a fast pruning among candidates. Meanwhile, our second stage employs a dual-encoder architecture, which effectively attends to the input triplet of reference-text-candidate and re-ranks the candidates. Both stages utilize a vision-and-language pre-trained network, which has proven beneficial for various downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks for the task.

However, current CoIR datasets are orders of magnitude smaller compared to other vision and language (V&L) datasets. Additionally, some of these datasets have noticeable issues, such as queries containing redundant modalities. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Large Scale Composed Image Retrieval (LaSCo) dataset, a new CoIR dataset which is ten times larger than existing ones. Pre-training on our LaSCo, shows a noteworthy improvement in performance, even in zero-shot. Furthermore, we propose a new approach for analyzing CoIR datasets and methods, which detects modality redundancy or necessity, in queries. We also introduce a new CoIR baseline, the Cross-Attention driven Shift Encoder (CASE). This baseline allows for early fusion of modalities using a cross-attention module and employs an additional auxiliary task during training. Our experiments demonstrate that this new baseline outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on established benchmarks like FashionIQ and CIRR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera Ready version for AAAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[VQA4CIR: Boosting Composed Image Retrieval with Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12273v1)** | 2023-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Albeit progress has been made in Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), we empirically find that a certain percentage of failure retrieval results are not consistent with their relative captions. To address this issue, this work provides a Visual Question Answering (VQA) perspective to boost the performance of CIR. The resulting VQA4CIR is a post-processing approach and can be directly plugged into existing CIR methods. Given the top-C retrieved images by a CIR method, VQA4CIR aims to decrease the adverse effect of the failure retrieval results being inconsistent with the relative caption. To find the retrieved images inconsistent with the relative caption, we resort to the "QA generation to VQA" self-verification pipeline. For QA generation, we suggest fine-tuning LLM (e.g., LLaMA) to generate several pairs of questions and answers from each relative caption. We then fine-tune LVLM (e.g., LLaVA) to obtain the VQA model. By feeding the retrieved image and question to the VQA model, one can find the images inconsistent with relative caption when the answer by VQA is inconsistent with the answer in the QA pair. Consequently, the CIR performance can be boosted by modifying the ranks of inconsistently retrieved images. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art CIR methods on the CIRR and Fashion-IQ datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-I2W: Mapping Images to Context-dependent Words for Accurate Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16137v2)** | 2023-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Different from Composed Image Retrieval task that requires expensive labels for training task-specific models, Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) involves diverse tasks with a broad range of visual content manipulation intent that could be related to domain, scene, object, and attribute. The key challenge for ZS-CIR tasks is to learn a more accurate image representation that has adaptive attention to the reference image for various manipulation descriptions. In this paper, we propose a novel context-dependent mapping network, named Context-I2W, for adaptively converting description-relevant Image information into a pseudo-word token composed of the description for accurate ZS-CIR. Specifically, an Intent View Selector first dynamically learns a rotation rule to map the identical image to a task-specific manipulation view. Then a Visual Target Extractor further captures local information covering the main targets in ZS-CIR tasks under the guidance of multiple learnable queries. The two complementary modules work together to map an image to a context-dependent pseudo-word token without extra supervision. Our model shows strong generalization ability on four ZS-CIR tasks, including domain conversion, object composition, object manipulation, and attribute manipulation. It obtains consistent and significant performance boosts ranging from 1.88% to 3.60% over the best methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results on ZS-CIR.

Existing approaches to solving this challenging task learn a mapping from the (reference image, modification text)-pair to an image embedding that is then matched against a large image corpus. One area that has not yet been explored is the reverse direction, which asks the question, what reference image when modified as described by the text would produce the given target image? In this work we propose a bi-directional training scheme that leverages such reversed queries and can be applied to existing composed image retrieval architectures with minimum changes, which improves the performance of the model. To encode the bi-directional query we prepend a learnable token to the modification text that designates the direction of the query and then finetune the parameters of the text embedding module. We make no other changes to the network architecture. Experiments on two standard datasets show that our novel approach achieves improved performance over a baseline BLIP-based model that itself already achieves competitive performance.

Most existing CIR models adopt the late-fusion strategy to combine visual and language features. Besides, several approaches have also been suggested to generate a pseudo-word token from the reference image, which is further integrated into the relative caption for CIR. However, these pseudo-word-based prompting methods have limitations when target image encompasses complex changes on reference image, e.g., object removal and attribute modification. In this work, we demonstrate that learning an appropriate sentence-level prompt for the relative caption (SPRC) is sufficient for achieving effective composed image retrieval. Instead of relying on pseudo-word-based prompts, we propose to leverage pretrained V-L models, e.g., BLIP-2, to generate sentence-level prompts. By concatenating the learned sentence-level prompt with the relative caption, one can readily use existing text-based image retrieval models to enhance CIR performance. Furthermore, we introduce both image-text contrastive loss and text prompt alignment loss to enforce the learning of suitable sentence-level prompts. Experiments show that our proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art CIR methods on the Fashion-IQ and CIRR datasets.

| **[NEUCORE: Neural Concept Reasoning for Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01358v1)** | 2023-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed image retrieval which combines a reference image and a text modifier to identify the desired target image is a challenging task, and requires the model to comprehend both vision and language modalities and their interactions. Existing approaches focus on holistic multi-modal interaction modeling, and ignore the composed and complimentary property between the reference image and text modifier. In order to better utilize the complementarity of multi-modal inputs for effective information fusion and retrieval, we move the multi-modal understanding to fine-granularity at concept-level, and learn the multi-modal concept alignment to identify the visual location in reference or target images corresponding to text modifier. Toward the end, we propose a NEUral COncept REasoning (NEUCORE) model which incorporates multi-modal concept alignment and progressive multimodal fusion over aligned concepts. Specifically, considering that text modifier may refer to semantic concepts not existing in the reference image and requiring to be added into the target image, we learn the multi-modal concept alignment between the text modifier and the concatenation of reference and target images, under multiple-instance learning framework with image and sentence level weak supervision. Furthermore, based on aligned concepts, to form discriminative fusion features of the input modalities for accurate target image retrieval, we propose a progressive fusion strategy with unified execution architecture instantiated by the attended language semantic concepts. Our proposed approach is evaluated on three datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decompose Semantic Shifts for Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09531v1)** | 2023-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed image retrieval is a type of image retrieval task where the user provides a reference image as a starting point and specifies a text on how to shift from the starting point to the desired target image. However, most existing methods focus on the composition learning of text and reference images and oversimplify the text as a description, neglecting the inherent structure and the user's shifting intention of the texts. As a result, these methods typically take shortcuts that disregard the visual cue of the reference images. To address this issue, we reconsider the text as instructions and propose a Semantic Shift network (SSN) that explicitly decomposes the semantic shifts into two steps: from the reference image to the visual prototype and from the visual prototype to the target image. Specifically, SSN explicitly decomposes the instructions into two components: degradation and upgradation, where the degradation is used to picture the visual prototype from the reference image, while the upgradation is used to enrich the visual prototype into the final representations to retrieve the desired target image. The experimental results show that the proposed SSN demonstrates a significant improvement of 5.42% and 1.37% on the CIRR and FashionIQ datasets, respectively, and establishes a new state-of-the-art performance. Codes will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Target-Guided Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01366v1)** | 2023-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed image retrieval (CIR) is a new and flexible image retrieval paradigm, which can retrieve the target image for a multimodal query, including a reference image and its corresponding modification text. Although existing efforts have achieved compelling success, they overlook the conflict relationship modeling between the reference image and the modification text for improving the multimodal query composition and the adaptive matching degree modeling for promoting the ranking of the candidate images that could present different levels of matching degrees with the given query. To address these two limitations, in this work, we propose a Target-Guided Composed Image Retrieval network (TG-CIR). In particular, TG-CIR first extracts the unified global and local attribute features for the reference/target image and the modification text with the contrastive language-image pre-training model (CLIP) as the backbone, where an orthogonal regularization is introduced to promote the independence among the attribute features. Then TG-CIR designs a target-query relationship-guided multimodal query composition module, comprising a target-free student composition branch and a target-based teacher composition branch, where the target-query relationship is injected into the teacher branch for guiding the conflict relationship modeling of the student branch. Last, apart from the conventional batch-based classification loss, TG-CIR additionally introduces a batch-based target similarity-guided matching degree regularization to promote the metric learning process. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning with Multi-modal Gradient Attention for Explainable Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16649v1)** | 2023-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of composed image retrieval that takes an input query consisting of an image and a modification text indicating the desired changes to be made on the image and retrieves images that match these changes. Current state-of-the-art techniques that address this problem use global features for the retrieval, resulting in incorrect localization of the regions of interest to be modified because of the global nature of the features, more so in cases of real-world, in-the-wild images. Since modifier texts usually correspond to specific local changes in an image, it is critical that models learn local features to be able to both localize and retrieve better. To this end, our key novelty is a new gradient-attention-based learning objective that explicitly forces the model to focus on the local regions of interest being modified in each retrieval step. We achieve this by first proposing a new visual image attention computation technique, which we call multi-modal gradient attention (MMGrad) that is explicitly conditioned on the modifier text. We next demonstrate how MMGrad can be incorporated into an end-to-end model training strategy with a new learning objective that explicitly forces these MMGrad attention maps to highlight the correct local regions corresponding to the modifier text. By training retrieval models with this new loss function, we show improved grounding by means of better visual attention maps, leading to better explainability of the models as well as competitive quantitative retrieval performance on standard benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

Given that recent research has demonstrated the efficacy of large-scale vision and language pre-trained (VLP) models in various tasks, we rely on features from the OpenAI CLIP model to tackle the considered task. We initially perform a task-oriented fine-tuning of both CLIP encoders using the element-wise sum of visual and textual features. Then, in the second stage, we train a Combiner network that learns to combine the image-text features integrating the bimodal information and providing combined features used to perform the retrieval. We use contrastive learning in both stages of training. Starting from the bare CLIP features as a baseline, experimental results show that the task-oriented fine-tuning and the carefully crafted Combiner network are highly effective and outperform more complex state-of-the-art approaches on FashionIQ and CIRR, two popular and challenging datasets for composed image retrieval.

The high effort and cost required for labeling datasets for CIR hamper the widespread usage of existing methods, as they rely on supervised learning. In this work, we propose a new task, Zero-Shot CIR (ZS-CIR), that aims to address CIR without requiring a labeled training dataset. Our approach, named zero-Shot composEd imAge Retrieval with textuaL invErsion (SEARLE), maps the visual features of the reference image into a pseudo-word token in CLIP token embedding space and integrates it with the relative caption. To support research on ZS-CIR, we introduce an open-domain benchmarking dataset named Composed Image Retrieval on Common Objects in context (CIRCO), which is the first dataset for CIR containing multiple ground truths for each query. The experiments show that SEARLE exhibits better performance than the baselines on the two main datasets for CIR tasks, FashionIQ and CIRR, and on the proposed CIRCO. The dataset, the code and the model are publicly available at https://github.com/miccunifi/SEARLE.</p></details> | ICCV2023 |
| **[Ranking-aware Uncertainty for Text-guided Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08131v1)** | 2023-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided image retrieval is to incorporate conditional text to better capture users' intent. Traditionally, the existing methods focus on minimizing the embedding distances between the source inputs and the targeted image, using the provided triplets $\langle$source image, source text, target image$\rangle$. However, such triplet optimization may limit the learned retrieval model to capture more detailed ranking information, e.g., the triplets are one-to-one correspondences and they fail to account for many-to-many correspondences arising from semantic diversity in feedback languages and images. To capture more ranking information, we propose a novel ranking-aware uncertainty approach to model many-to-many correspondences by only using the provided triplets. We introduce uncertainty learning to learn the stochastic ranking list of features. Specifically, our approach mainly comprises three components: (1) In-sample uncertainty, which aims to capture semantic diversity using a Gaussian distribution derived from both combined and target features; (2) Cross-sample uncertainty, which further mines the ranking information from other samples' distributions; and (3) Distribution regularization, which aligns the distributional representations of source inputs and targeted image. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods, our proposed method achieves significant results on two public datasets for composed image retrieval.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods rely on supervised learning of CIR models using labeled triplets consisting of the query image, text specification, and the target image. Labeling such triplets is expensive and hinders broad applicability of CIR. In this work, we propose to study an important task, Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR), whose goal is to build a CIR model without requiring labeled triplets for training. To this end, we propose a novel method, called Pic2Word, that requires only weakly labeled image-caption pairs and unlabeled image datasets to train. Unlike existing supervised CIR models, our model trained on weakly labeled or unlabeled datasets shows strong generalization across diverse ZS-CIR tasks, e.g., attribute editing, object composition, and domain conversion. Our approach outperforms several supervised CIR methods on the common CIR benchmark, CIRR and Fashion-IQ.

Existing methods have only been applied to non-complex images within narrow domains, such as fashion products, thereby limiting the scope of study on in-depth visual reasoning in rich image and language contexts. To address this issue, we collect the Compose Image Retrieval on Real-life images (CIRR) dataset, which consists of over 36,000 pairs of crowd-sourced, open-domain images with human-generated modifying text. To extend current methods to the open-domain, we propose CIRPLANT, a transformer based model that leverages rich pre-trained vision-and-language (V&L) knowledge for modifying visual features conditioned on natural language. Retrieval is then done by nearest neighbor lookup on the modified features. We demonstrate that with a relatively simple architecture, CIRPLANT outperforms existing methods on open-domain images, while matching state-of-the-art accuracy on the existing narrow datasets, such as fashion. Together with the release of CIRR, we believe this work will inspire further research on composed image retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2021.

| **[Toward Clinically Grounded Foundation Models in Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23807v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis, prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified: biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization, excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation, insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size. These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.</p></details> |  |
| **[Caption Injection for Optimization in Generative Search Engine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04080v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Search Engines (GSEs) leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate multi-source information and provide users with accurate and comprehensive responses. Unlike traditional search engines that present results in ranked lists, GSEs shift users' attention from sequential browsing to content-driven subjective perception, driving a paradigm shift in information retrieval. In this context, enhancing the subjective visibility of content through Generative Search Engine Optimization (G-SEO) methods has emerged as a new research focus. With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) techniques, GSEs can now efficiently integrate text, images, audio, and video, producing richer responses that better satisfy complex information needs. Existing G-SEO methods, however, remain limited to text-based optimization and fail to fully exploit multimodal data. To address this gap, we propose Caption Injection, the first multimodal G-SEO approach, which extracts captions from images and injects them into textual content, integrating visual semantics to enhance the subjective visibility of content in generative search scenarios. We systematically evaluate Caption Injection on MRAMG, a benchmark for MRAG, under both unimodal and multimodal settings. Experimental results show that Caption Injection significantly outperforms text-only G-SEO baselines under the G-Eval metric, demonstrating the necessity and effectiveness of multimodal integration in G-SEO to improve user-perceived content visibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Perspectival Biases in Cross-Modal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26861v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval systems are expected to operate in a semantic space, agnostic to the language or cultural origin of the query. In practice, however, retrieval outcomes systematically reflect perspectival biases: deviations shaped by linguistic prevalence and cultural associations. We study two such biases. First, prevalence bias refers to the tendency to favor entries from prevalent languages over semantically faithful entries in image-to-text retrieval. Second, association bias refers to the tendency to favor images culturally associated with the query over semantically correct ones in text-to-image retrieval. Results show that explicit alignment is a more effective strategy for mitigating prevalence bias. However, association bias remains a distinct and more challenging problem. These findings suggest that achieving truly equitable multimodal systems requires targeted strategies beyond simple data scaling and that bias arising from cultural association may be treated as a more challenging problem than one arising from linguistic prevalence.</p></details> |  |
| **[RzenEmbed: Towards Comprehensive Multimodal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27350v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has extended CLIP-based frameworks to produce powerful, universal embeddings for retrieval tasks. However, existing methods primarily focus on natural images, offering limited support for other crucial visual modalities such as videos and visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce RzenEmbed, a unified framework to learn embeddings across a diverse set of modalities, including text, images, videos, and visual documents. We employ a novel two-stage training strategy to learn discriminative representations. The first stage focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. In the second stage, we introduce an improved InfoNCE loss, incorporating two key enhancements. Firstly, a hardness-weighted mechanism guides the model to prioritize challenging samples by assigning them higher weights within each batch. Secondly, we implement an approach to mitigate the impact of false negatives and alleviate data noise. This strategy not only enhances the model's discriminative power but also improves its instruction-following capabilities. We further boost performance with learnable temperature parameter and model souping. RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark. It not only achieves the best overall score but also outperforms all prior work on the challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks. Our models are available in https://huggingface.co/qihoo360/RzenEmbed.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MRAG frameworks primarily adhere to rigid, single-step retrieval strategies that fail to address real-world challenges of information acquisition and query reformulation. In this work, we introduce the task of Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation Planning (MRAG Planning) that aims at effective information seeking and integration while minimizing computational overhead. Specifically, we propose CogPlanner, an agentic plug-and-play framework inspired by human cognitive processes, which iteratively determines query reformulation and retrieval strategies to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. CogPlanner supports parallel and sequential modeling paradigms. Furthermore, we introduce CogBench, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the MRAG Planning task and facilitate lightweight CogPlanner integration with resource-efficient MLLMs, such as Qwen2-VL-7B-Cog. Experimental results demonstrate that CogPlanner significantly outperforms existing MRAG baselines, offering improvements in both accuracy and efficiency with minimal additional computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR-AP 2025</p></details> |

As audiovisual media becomes a prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess multimodal RAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/alexmartin1722/mirage</p></details> |

However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 UniReps Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Open Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Factual Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22521v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional, and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines, highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image generation.</p></details> | Preprint |

This paper introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes, and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved. Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1 achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability, as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[TRACE: Grounding Time Series in Context for Multimodal Embedding and Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09114v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ubiquity of dynamic data in domains such as weather, healthcare, and energy underscores a growing need for effective interpretation and retrieval of time-series data. These data are inherently tied to domain-specific contexts, such as clinical notes or weather narratives, making cross-modal retrieval essential not only for downstream tasks but also for developing robust time-series foundation models by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the increasing demand, time-series retrieval remains largely underexplored. Existing methods often lack semantic grounding, struggle to align heterogeneous modalities, and have limited capacity for handling multi-channel signals. To address this gap, we propose TRACE, a generic multimodal retriever that grounds time-series embeddings in aligned textual context. TRACE enables fine-grained channel-level alignment and employs hard negative mining to facilitate semantically meaningful retrieval. It supports flexible cross-modal retrieval modes, including Text-to-Timeseries and Timeseries-to-Text, effectively linking linguistic descriptions with complex temporal patterns. By retrieving semantically relevant pairs, TRACE enriches downstream models with informative context, leading to improved predictive accuracy and interpretability. Beyond a static retrieval engine, TRACE also serves as a powerful standalone encoder, with lightweight task-specific tuning that refines context-aware representations while maintaining strong cross-modal alignment. These representations achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream forecasting and classification tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple domains highlight its dual utility, as both an effective encoder for downstream applications and a general-purpose retriever to enhance time-series models.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCA: Modality Composition Awareness for Robust Composed Multimodal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15543v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval, which seeks to retrieve relevant content across modalities such as text or image, supports applications from AI search to contents production. Despite the success of separate-encoder approaches like CLIP align modality-specific embeddings with contrastive learning, recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable a unified encoder that directly processes composed inputs. While flexible and advanced, we identify that unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts. We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue. Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts. These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed representation and its unimodal counterparts. Experiments on various benchmarks show gains in out-of-distribution retrieval, highlighting modality composition awareness as a effective principle for robust composed multimodal retrieval when utilizing MLLMs as the unified encoder.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Beyond Context: A Survey of Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Document Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15253v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document understanding is critical for applications from financial analysis to scientific discovery. Current approaches, whether OCR-based pipelines feeding Large Language Models (LLMs) or native Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), face key limitations: the former loses structural detail, while the latter struggles with context modeling. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps ground models in external data, but documents' multimodal nature, i.e., combining text, tables, charts, and layout, demands a more advanced paradigm: Multimodal RAG. This approach enables holistic retrieval and reasoning across all modalities, unlocking comprehensive document intelligence. Recognizing its importance, this paper presents a systematic survey of Multimodal RAG for document understanding. We propose a taxonomy based on domain, retrieval modality, and granularity, and review advances involving graph structures and agentic frameworks. We also summarize key datasets, benchmarks, and applications, and highlight open challenges in efficiency, fine-grained representation, and robustness, providing a roadmap for future progress in document AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supervised Fine-Tuning or Contrastive Learning? Towards Better Multimodal LLM Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14824v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders, various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts ''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components: weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and applications in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal RAG for Unstructured Data:Leveraging Modality-Aware Knowledge Graphs with Hybrid Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14592v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems primarily operate on unimodal textual data, limiting their effectiveness on unstructured multimodal documents. Such documents often combine text, images, tables, equations, and graphs, each contributing unique information. In this work, we present a Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal, where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of 0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG systems by enabling modality-aware reasoning over unstructured multimodal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, submitted for review</p></details> |

In light of this, ideal text-to-image (T2I) retrievers should prioritize specific visual attributes relevant to queries. To evaluate current retrievers on handling attribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with 9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like retrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot ability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image embeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other details. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with this limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image embeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose to use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers, which boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for deriving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base retriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two acceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear approximations. We show that the former yields a 15% improvement in Recall@5 when prompts are predefined, while the latter achieves an 8% improvement when prompts are only available during inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; 27 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical NLP tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[PRISM: Enhancing Protein Inverse Folding through Fine-Grained Retrieval on Structure-Sequence Multimodal Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11750v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing protein sequences that fold into a target three-dimensional structure, known as the inverse folding problem, is central to protein engineering but remains challenging due to the vast sequence space and the importance of local structural constraints. Existing deep learning approaches achieve strong recovery rates, yet they lack explicit mechanisms to reuse fine-grained structure-sequence patterns that are conserved across natural proteins. We present PRISM, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework for inverse folding that retrieves fine-grained representations of potential motifs from known proteins and integrates them with a hybrid self-cross attention decoder. PRISM is formulated as a latent-variable probabilistic model and implemented with an efficient approximation, combining theoretical grounding with practical scalability. Across five benchmarks (CATH-4.2, TS50, TS500, CAMEO 2022, and the PDB date split), PRISM establishes new state of the art in both perplexity and amino acid recovery, while also improving foldability metrics (RMSD, TM-score, pLDDT), demonstrating that fine-grained multimodal retrieval is a powerful and efficient paradigm for protein sequence design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lightweight Joint Optimization of General-Purpose Vision-Language Models and Retrievers for RAG-Based Medical Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17394v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieving relevant visual and textual information from medical literature and hospital records can enhance diagnostic accuracy for clinical image interpretation. We develop a multimodal retrieval model jointly optimized with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG which doesn't backpropagate LVLM errors to the retriever. Using only general-purpose backbones with lightweight fine-tuning, our model achieves competitive results with medically-pretrained models on clinical classification and VQA tasks. In a novel analysis, we find that different top-retrieved images often yield different predictions for the same target, and that these cases are challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle, and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room for improvement by future methods.

| **[MRMR: A Realistic and Expert-Level Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Reasoning-Intensive Multimodal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09510v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MRMR, the first expert-level multidisciplinary multimodal retrieval benchmark requiring intensive reasoning. MRMR contains 1,502 queries spanning 23 domains, with positive documents carefully verified by human experts. Compared to prior benchmarks, MRMR introduces three key advancements. First, it challenges retrieval systems across diverse areas of expertise, enabling fine-grained model comparison across domains. Second, queries are reasoning-intensive, with images requiring deeper interpretation such as diagnosing microscopic slides. We further introduce Contradiction Retrieval, a novel task requiring models to identify conflicting concepts. Finally, queries and documents are constructed as image-text interleaved sequences. Unlike earlier benchmarks restricted to single images or unimodal documents, MRMR offers a realistic setting with multi-image queries and mixed-modality corpus documents. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 4 categories of multimodal retrieval systems and 14 frontier models on MRMR. The text embedding model Qwen3-Embedding with LLM-generated image captions achieves the highest performance, highlighting substantial room for improving multimodal retrieval models. Although latest multimodal models such as Ops-MM-Embedding perform competitively on expert-domain queries, they fall short on reasoning-intensive tasks. We believe that MRMR paves the way for advancing multimodal retrieval in more realistic and challenging scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This can affect the downstream robustness of models incorporating CLIP in the pipeline, such as text-to-image generative models or large vision language models. While some efforts have been done towards making the CLIP image encoders robust, the robustness of text encoders remains unexplored. In this work, we cover this gap in the literature. We propose LEAF: an efficient adversarial finetuning method for the text domain, with the ability to scale to large CLIP models. Our models significantly improve the zero-shot adversarial accuracy in the text domain, while maintaining the vision performance provided by robust image encoders. When combined with text-to-image diffusion models, we can improve the generation quality under adversarial noise. In multimodal retrieval tasks, LEAF improves the recall under adversarial noise over standard CLIP models. Finally, we show that robust text encoders facilitate better reconstruction of input text from its embedding via direct optimization. We open-source our code ( https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/LEAF ) and models ( https://huggingface.co/LEAF-CLIP ).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, existing benchmarks remain limited in modality coverage and format diversity, often focusing on single- or limited-modality tasks, or coarse-grained scene understanding. To address these gaps, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale, manually verified benchmark constructed from 599 publicly available videos, yielding 5,360 open-ended QA pairs. CFVBench spans high-density formats and domains such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials, requiring models to retrieve and reason over long temporal video spans while maintaining fine-grained multimodal information. Using CFVBench, we systematically evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 widely-used MLLMs, revealing a critical bottleneck: current models (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle to capture transient yet essential fine-grained multimodal details. To mitigate this, we propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external tools when necessary. Experiments show that AVR consistently enhances fine-grained multimodal comprehension and improves performance across all evaluated MLLMs</p></details> |  |
| **[UNIDOC-BENCH: A Unified Benchmark for Document-Centric Multimodal RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03663v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) is a key approach for applying large language models (LLMs) and agents to real-world knowledge bases, yet current evaluations are fragmented, focusing on either text or images in isolation or on simplified multimodal setups that fail to capture document-centric multimodal use cases. In this paper, we introduce UniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from 70k real-world PDF pages across eight domains. Our pipeline extracts and links evidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates 1,600 multimodal QA pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical reasoning queries. To ensure reliability, 20% of QA pairs are validated by multiple annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports apples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: (1) text-only, (2) image-only, (3) multimodal text-image fusion, and (4) multimodal joint retrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools, prompts, and evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that multimodal text-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly multimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images alone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate. Beyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context complements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers actionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[M3Retrieve: Benchmarking Multimodal Retrieval for Medicine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06888v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing use of RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG), strong retrieval models have become more important than ever. In healthcare, multimodal retrieval models that combine information from both text and images offer major advantages for many downstream tasks such as question answering, cross-modal retrieval, and multimodal summarization, since medical data often includes both formats. However, there is currently no standard benchmark to evaluate how well these models perform in medical settings. To address this gap, we introduce M3Retrieve, a Multimodal Medical Retrieval Benchmark. M3Retrieve, spans 5 domains,16 medical fields, and 4 distinct tasks, with over 1.2 Million text documents and 164K multimodal queries, all collected under approved licenses. We evaluate leading multimodal retrieval models on this benchmark to explore the challenges specific to different medical specialities and to understand their impact on retrieval performance. By releasing M3Retrieve, we aim to enable systematic evaluation, foster model innovation, and accelerate research toward building more capable and reliable multimodal retrieval systems for medical applications. The dataset and the baselines code are available in this github page https://github.com/AkashGhosh/M3Retrieve.</p></details> | EMNLP Mains 2025 |
| **[Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoders for Large Scale Vision-Language Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06820v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval still leans on embedding-based models like CLIP for fast vector search over pre-computed image embeddings. Yet, unlike text retrieval, where joint-encoder rerankers are standard, comparable vision--language rerankers are largely absent. We find that seminal joint encoders such as BLIP are severely bottlenecked by an expensive visual feature-extraction stage, preventing practical deployment at scale. Motivated by this bottleneck, we introduce EDJE, an Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoder that precomputes vision tokens offline and compresses them via a lightweight attention-based adapter, so online inference runs only a compact joint encoder over a small set of visual tokens plus the text. EDJE preserves strong retrieval performance while drastically reducing storage and online compute, enabling high-throughput inference. Specifically, EDJE processes 50k image--text pairs/second while requiring 49kB of disk storage per image, matching prior art on Flickr (zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval. The implementation and checkpoints will be made publicly available shortly.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Guided Query Refinement: Multimodal Hybrid Retrieval with Test-Time Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05038v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal encoders have pushed the boundaries of visual document retrieval, matching textual query tokens directly to image patches and achieving state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks. Recent models relying on this paradigm have massively scaled the sizes of their query and document representations, presenting obstacles to deployment and scalability in real-world pipelines. Furthermore, purely vision-centric approaches may be constrained by the inherent modality gap still exhibited by modern vision-language models. In this work, we connect these challenges to the paradigm of hybrid retrieval, investigating whether a lightweight dense text retriever can enhance a stronger vision-centric model. Existing hybrid methods, which rely on coarse-grained fusion of ranks or scores, fail to exploit the rich interactions within each model's representation space. To address this, we introduce Guided Query Refinement (GQR), a novel test-time optimization method that refines a primary retriever's query embedding using guidance from a complementary retriever's scores. Through extensive experiments on visual document retrieval benchmarks, we demonstrate that GQR allows vision-centric models to match the performance of models with significantly larger representations, while being up to 14x faster and requiring 54x less memory. Our findings show that GQR effectively pushes the Pareto frontier for performance and efficiency in multimodal retrieval. We release our code at https://github.com/IBM/test-time-hybrid-retrieval</p></details> |  |

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced language models by incorporating external knowledge, existing text-based retrievers rely on clean, structured input and struggle with the visually and semantically rich content found in real-world documents such as PDFs, slides, or videos. Recent work such as ColPali has shown that preserving document layout using image-based representations can improve retrieval quality. Building on this, and inspired by the capabilities of recent multimodal models such as Qwen2.5-Omni, we extend retrieval beyond text and images to also support audio and video modalities. Omni-Embed-Nemotron enables both cross-modal (e.g., text - video) and joint-modal (e.g., text - video+audio) retrieval using a single model. We describe the architecture, training setup, and evaluation results of Omni-Embed-Nemotron, and demonstrate its effectiveness in text, image, and video retrieval.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks primarily probe surface-level semantic correspondence (e.g., object-text matching) while failing to assess the deeper reasoning required to capture complex relationships between visual and textual information. To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a reasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents the following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond shallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial, and causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural images, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across content types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple images and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting real-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived either from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of public datasets. Despite achieving strong results on existing benchmarks, current state-of-the-art models still struggle on MR$^2$-Bench: for example, the leading Seed1.6-Embedding model attains a Recall@1 of 77.78 on MMEB, but only 9.91 on MR$^2$-Bench. This substantial performance gap highlights both the increased challenge posed by our benchmark and the pressing need for further advances in reasoning-intensive multimodal retrieval. The dataset and evaluation code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/MR2-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Contrastive Learning for Universal Multimodal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25638v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation. Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP) using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We introduce difficulty-based and ambiguity-aware filtering strategies, alongside MM-RAGChecker, a claim-level diagnostic tool. Our results demonstrate substantial accuracy reductions under difficult and ambiguous queries, highlighting prevalent hallucinations. MM-RAGChecker effectively diagnoses these issues, guiding future improvements in Visual RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

However, Verilog code inherently encodes structural information of hardware circuits. Effectively leveraging this structural information to enhance the functional and syntactic correctness of LLM-generated Verilog code remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose VeriGRAG , a novel framework that extracts structural graph embeddings from Verilog code using graph neural networks (GNNs). A multimodal retriever then selects the graph embeddings most relevant to the given generation task, which are aligned with the code modality through the VeriFormer module to generate structure-aware soft prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that VeriGRAG substantially improves the correctness of Verilog code generation, achieving state-of-the-art or superior performance across both VerilogEval and RTLLM benchmarks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

The system constructs a dual-modal knowledge base from reference texts and images, enabling raw visual, edge-enhanced, and semantic retrieval to identify stylistically similar objects. Retrieved candidates are synthesized by the VLM to generate structured inferences, including chronological, geographical, and cultural attributions, alongside interpretive justifications. We evaluate the system on a set of Eastern Eurasian Bronze Age artifacts from the British Museum. Expert evaluation demonstrates that the system produces meaningful and interpretable outputs, offering scholars concrete starting points for analysis and significantly alleviating the cognitive burden of navigating vast comparative corpora.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation, prevailing methods remain limited: (i) reasoning is frequently neither clinically interpretable nor aligned with guidelines, reflecting mere aggregation of tool outputs; (ii) multimodal evidence is insufficiently fused, yielding text-only rationales that are not visually grounded; and (iii) systems rarely detect or resolve cross-tool inconsistencies and provide no principled verification mechanisms. To bridge the above gaps, we present RadAgents, a multi-agent framework for CXR interpretation that couples clinical priors with task-aware multimodal reasoning. In addition, we integrate grounding and multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts, resulting in outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with clinical practice.</p></details> | In progress |

Users frequently struggle to express their complaints clearly in text but can easily upload videos depicting product defects (e.g., vague text such as `worst product' paired with a 5-second video depicting a broken headphone with the right earcup). This paper formulates a new task in the field of complaint mining to aid the common users' need to write an expressive complaint, which is Complaint Description from Videos (CoD-V) (e.g., to help the above user articulate her complaint about the defective right earcup). To this end, we introduce ComVID, a video complaint dataset containing 1,175 complaint videos and the corresponding descriptions, also annotated with the emotional state of the complainer. Additionally, we present a new complaint retention (CR) evaluation metric that discriminates the proposed (CoD-V) task against standard video summary generation and description tasks. To strengthen this initiative, we introduce a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) embedded VideoLLaMA2-7b model, designed to generate complaints while accounting for the user's emotional state. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of several Video Language Models on several tasks (pre-trained and fine-tuned versions) with a range of established evaluation metrics, including METEOR, perplexity, and the Coleman-Liau readability score, among others. Our study lays the foundation for a new research direction to provide a platform for users to express complaints through video.

However, their high technical entry barrier limits accessibility for non-expert users. This study presents an open-source conversational assistant that integrates multimodal retrieval and large language models (LLMs) to enable natural language interaction with heterogeneous agricultural and geospatial data. The proposed architecture combines orthophotos, Sentinel-2 vegetation indices, and user-provided documents through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), allowing the system to flexibly determine whether to rely on multimodal evidence, textual knowledge, or both in formulating an answer. To assess response quality, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge methodology using Qwen3-32B in a zero-shot, unsupervised setting, applying direct scoring in a multi-dimensional quantitative evaluation framework. Preliminary results show that the system is capable of generating clear, relevant, and context-aware responses to agricultural queries, while remaining reproducible and scalable across geographic regions. The primary contributions of this work include an architecture for fusing multimodal EO and textual knowledge sources, a demonstration of lowering the barrier to access specialized agricultural information through natural language interaction, and an open and reproducible design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 4th International Conference on Geographic Information and Remote Sensing Technology</p></details> |

However, current methods either condense queries and candidates into a single vector, potentially limiting the expressiveness for fine-grained information, or produce too many vectors that are prohibitively expensive for multi-vector retrieval. In this work, we introduce MetaEmbed, a new framework for multimodal retrieval that rethinks how multimodal embeddings are constructed and interacted with at scale. During training, a fixed number of learnable Meta Tokens are appended to the input sequence. At test-time, their last-layer contextualized representations serve as compact yet expressive multi-vector embeddings. Through the proposed Matryoshka Multi-Vector Retrieval training, MetaEmbed learns to organize information by granularity across multiple vectors. As a result, we enable test-time scaling in multimodal retrieval, where users can balance retrieval quality against efficiency demands by selecting the number of tokens used for indexing and retrieval interactions. Extensive evaluations on the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB) and the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark (ViDoRe) confirm that MetaEmbed achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance while scaling robustly to models with 32B parameters.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach merely reuses the Key-Value (KV) cache of the initial sequence of prompt, resulting in full KV cache recomputation even if the prefix differs slightly. This becomes particularly inefficient in the context of interleaved text and images, as well as multimodal retrieval-augmented generation. This paper proposes position-independent caching as a more effective approach for multimodal information management. We have designed and implemented a caching system, named MPIC, to address both system-level and algorithm-level challenges. MPIC stores the KV cache on local disks when receiving multimodal data, and calculates and loads the KV cache in parallel during inference. To mitigate accuracy degradation, we have incorporated the integrated reuse and recompute mechanism within the system. The experimental results demonstrate that MPIC can achieve up to 54\% reduction in response time and 2$\times$ improvement in throughput compared to existing context caching systems, while maintaining negligible or no accuracy loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 13 figures, the second version</p></details> |

Casting ranking as lossy source coding, we derive a single-letter rate-distortion function $R(D)$ for reciprocal-rank distortion and prove a converse bound that splits into a modality-balanced term plus a skew penalty $\kappa\,\Delta H$ capturing entropy imbalance and cross-modal redundancy. We then construct an explicit entropy-weighted stochastic quantizer with an adaptive, per-modality temperature decoder; a Blahut-Arimoto argument shows this scheme achieves distortion within $O(n^{-1})$ of $R(D)$ using $n$ training triples. A VC-type analysis yields the first finite-sample excess-risk bound whose complexity scales sub-linearly in both the number of modalities and the entropy gap. Experiments on controlled Gaussian mixtures and Flickr30k confirm that our adaptive codes sit within two percentage points of the theoretical frontier, while fixed-temperature and naive CLIP baselines lag significantly. Taken together, our results give a principled answer to "how many bits per query are necessary" for high-quality multimodal retrieval and provide design guidance for entropy-aware contrastive objectives, continual-learning retrievers, and retrieval-augmented generators.</p></details> | ICCV MRR 2025 |

The effectiveness of Vision-language RAG systems hinges on multimodal retrieval, which is inherently challenging due to the diverse modalities and knowledge granularities in both queries and knowledge bases. Existing methods have not fully tapped into the potential interplay between these elements. We propose a multimodal RAG system featuring a coarse-to-fine, multi-step retrieval that harmonizes multiple granularities and modalities to enhance efficacy. Our system begins with a broad initial search aligning knowledge granularity for cross-modal retrieval, followed by a multimodal fusion reranking to capture the nuanced multimodal information for top entity selection. A text reranker then filters out the most relevant fine-grained section for augmented generation. Extensive experiments on the InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA benchmarks show our method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance and highly competitive answering results, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing KB-VQA systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents. In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets.

In this work, we introduce a novel multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) framework. On top of classical RAG architecture, we further the framework to devise a two-branch multimodal encoder structure that the image branch employs a visual encoder composed of ResNet and Transformer to extract the characteristic of building damage after disaster, and the text branch harnesses a BERT retriever for the text vectorization of posts as well as insurance policies and for the construction of a retrievable restoration index. To impose cross-modal semantic alignment, the model integrates a cross-modal interaction module to bridge the semantic representation between image and text via multi-head attention. Meanwhile, in the generation module, the introduced modal attention gating mechanism dynamically controls the role of visual evidence and text prior information during generation. The entire framework takes end-to-end training, and combines the comparison loss, the retrieval loss and the generation loss to form multi-task optimization objectives, and achieves image understanding and policy matching in collaborative learning. The results demonstrate superior performance in retrieval accuracy and classification index on damage severity, where the Top-1 retrieval accuracy has been improved by 9.6%.</p></details> |  |

Using over 3,600 digitized textbook pages largely from computer science textbooks and a Vision Language Model (VLM), we generate multi-vector representations capturing both textual and visual semantics. These embeddings are stored in a vector database. We issue a benchmark of 75 natural language queries and compare retrieval performance to ground truth and across four similarity (distance) measures. The study is intended to expose both the strengths and weakenesses of such an approach. We find that cosine similarity most effectively retrieves semantically and visually relevant pages. We further discuss the practicality of using a vector database and multi-modal embedding for operational information retrieval. Our paper is intended to offer design insights for discovery over digital libraries.

| **[PS-ReID: Advancing Person Re-Identification and Precise Segmentation with Multimodal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21595v2)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (ReID) plays a critical role in applications such as security surveillance and criminal investigations. Most traditional image-based ReID methods face challenges including occlusions and lighting changes, while text provides complementary information to mitigate these issues. However, the integration of both image and text modalities remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose {\bf PS-ReID}, a multimodal model that combines image and text inputs to enhance ReID performance. In contrast to existing ReID methods limited by cropped pedestrian images, our PS-ReID focuses on full-scene settings and introduces a multimodal ReID task that incorporates segmentation, enabling precise feature extraction of the queried individual, even under challenging conditions such as occlusion. To this end, our model adopts a dual-path asymmetric encoding scheme that explicitly separates query and target roles: the query branch captures identity-discriminative cues, while the target branch performs holistic scene reasoning. Additionally, a token-level ReID loss supervises identity-aware tokens, coupling retrieval and segmentation to yield masks that are both spatially precise and identity-consistent. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we construct M2ReID, currently the largest full-scene multimodal ReID dataset, with over 200K images and 4,894 identities, featuring multimodal queries and high-quality segmentation masks. Experimental results demonstrate that PS-ReID significantly outperforms unimodal query-based models in both ReID and segmentation tasks. The model excels in challenging real-world scenarios such as occlusion, low lighting, and background clutter, offering a robust and flexible solution for person retrieval and segmentation. All code, models, and datasets will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Conventional vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search, Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

Among these, multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications are promising because they combine the strengths of information retrieval and generative models, enhancing their utility across various domains, including clinical use cases. This paper introduces AlzheimerRAG, a Multimodal RAG application for clinical use cases, primarily focusing on Alzheimer's Disease case studies from PubMed articles. This application incorporates cross-modal attention fusion techniques to integrate textual and visual data processing by efficiently indexing and accessing vast amounts of biomedical literature. Our experimental results, compared to benchmarks such as BioASQ and PubMedQA, have yielded improved performance in the retrieval and synthesis of domain-specific information. We also present a case study using our multimodal RAG in various Alzheimer's clinical scenarios. We infer that AlzheimerRAG can generate responses with accuracy non-inferior to humans and with low rates of hallucination.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks focus on English-only document retrieval or only consider multilingual question-answering on a single-page image. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisR-Bench, a multilingual benchmark designed for question-driven multimodal retrieval in long documents. Our benchmark comprises over 35K high-quality QA pairs across 1.2K documents, enabling fine-grained evaluation of multimodal retrieval. VisR-Bench spans sixteen languages with three question types (figures, text, and tables), offering diverse linguistic and question coverage. Unlike prior datasets, we include queries without explicit answers, preventing models from relying on superficial keyword matching. We evaluate various retrieval models, including text-based methods, multimodal encoders, and MLLMs, providing insights into their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while MLLMs significantly outperform text-based and multimodal encoder models, they still struggle with structured tables and low-resource languages, highlighting key challenges in multilingual visual retrieval.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Zero-shot Multimodal Document Retrieval via Cross-modal Question Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17079v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have expanded information retrieval beyond purely textual inputs, enabling retrieval from complex real world documents that combine text and visuals. However, most documents are private either owned by individuals or confined within corporate silos and current retrievers struggle when faced with unseen domains or languages. To address this gap, we introduce PREMIR, a simple yet effective framework that leverages the broad knowledge of an MLLM to generate cross modal pre questions (preQs) before retrieval. Unlike earlier multimodal retrievers that compare embeddings in a single vector space, PREMIR leverages preQs from multiple complementary modalities to expand the scope of matching to the token level. Experiments show that PREMIR achieves state of the art performance on out of distribution benchmarks, including closed domain and multilingual settings, outperforming strong baselines across all retrieval metrics. We confirm the contribution of each component through in depth ablation studies, and qualitative analyses of the generated preQs further highlight the model's robustness in real world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniECS: Unified Multimodal E-Commerce Search Framework with Gated Cross-modal Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13843v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current e-commerce multimodal retrieval systems face two key limitations: they optimize for specific tasks with fixed modality pairings, and lack comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating unified retrieval approaches. To address these challenges, we introduce UniECS, a unified multimodal e-commerce search framework that handles all retrieval scenarios across image, text, and their combinations. Our work makes three key contributions. First, we propose a flexible architecture with a novel gated multimodal encoder that uses adaptive fusion mechanisms. This encoder integrates different modality representations while handling missing modalities. Second, we develop a comprehensive training strategy to optimize learning. It combines cross-modal alignment loss (CMAL), cohesive local alignment loss (CLAL), intra-modal contrastive loss (IMCL), and adaptive loss weighting. Third, we create M-BEER, a carefully curated multimodal benchmark containing 50K product pairs for e-commerce search evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniECS consistently outperforms existing methods across four e-commerce benchmarks with fine-tuning or zero-shot evaluation. On our M-BEER bench, UniECS achieves substantial improvements in cross-modal tasks (up to 28\% gain in R@10 for text-to-image retrieval) while maintaining parameter efficiency (0.2B parameters) compared to larger models like GME-Qwen2VL (2B) and MM-Embed (8B). Furthermore, we deploy UniECS in the e-commerce search platform of Kuaishou Inc. across two search scenarios, achieving notable improvements in Click-Through Rate (+2.74\%) and Revenue (+8.33\%). The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in both experimental and real-world settings.

While existing benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising 224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents' multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question, enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\% accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of native multimodal reasoning in current models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contribute equally, 26 pages, repo at https://github.com/MMBrowseComp/MM-BrowseComp</p></details> |

However, their use as writing assistants in specialized domains like finance, medicine, and law is often hampered by a lack of deep domain-specific knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. Existing solutions, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can suffer from inconsistency across multiple retrieval steps, while online search-based methods often degrade quality due to unreliable web content. To address these challenges, we introduce DeepWriter, a customizable, multimodal, long-form writing assistant that operates on a curated, offline knowledge base. DeepWriter leverages a novel pipeline that involves task decomposition, outline generation, multimodal retrieval, and section-by-section composition with reflection. By deeply mining information from a structured corpus and incorporating both textual and visual elements, DeepWriter generates coherent, factually grounded, and professional-grade documents. We also propose a hierarchical knowledge representation to enhance retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Our experiments on financial report generation demonstrate that DeepWriter produces high-quality, verifiable articles that surpasses existing baselines in factual accuracy and generated content quality.</p></details> | work in process |
| **[SMA: Who Said That? Auditing Membership Leakage in Semi-Black-box RAG Controlling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09105v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance, rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus undermining privacy leakage accountability To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities. To address the environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition, SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data provenance in complex generative systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Agent: Optimizing Planning Capability for Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08816v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has emerged as a promising solution to address the temporal limitations of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios like news analysis and trending topics. However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark. This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions. Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods while reducing redundant searches by 37%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Multimodal Sentiment Analysis via Contrastive Cross-modal Retrieval Augmentation and Hierachical Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07666v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal sentiment analysis is a fundamental problem in the field of affective computing. Although significant progress has been made in cross-modal interaction, it remains a challenge due to the insufficient reference context in cross-modal interactions. Current cross-modal approaches primarily focus on leveraging modality-level reference context within a individual sample for cross-modal feature enhancement, neglecting the potential cross-sample relationships that can serve as sample-level reference context to enhance the cross-modal features. To address this issue, we propose a novel multimodal retrieval-augmented framework to simultaneously incorporate inter-sample modality-level reference context and cross-sample sample-level reference context to enhance the multimodal features. In particular, we first design a contrastive cross-modal retrieval module to retrieve semantic similar samples and enhance target modality. To endow the model to capture both inter-sample and intra-sample information, we integrate two different types of prompts, modality-level prompts and sample-level prompts, to generate modality-level and sample-level reference contexts, respectively. Finally, we design a cross-modal retrieval-augmented encoder that simultaneously leverages modality-level and sample-level reference contexts to enhance the target modality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our model on two publicly available datasets.</p></details> | Under review |

In contrast, real-world applications often demand both multimodal inputs and multimodal outputs for effective communication and grounded reasoning. Motivated by the recent success of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs), we adopt RL as a principled and effective paradigm to address the multi-step, outcome-driven challenges inherent in multimodal output generation. Here, we introduce M2IO-R1, a novel framework for Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation (MRAMG) that supports both multimodal inputs and outputs. Central to our framework is an RL-based inserter, Inserter-R1-3B, trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization to guide image selection and placement in a controllable and semantically aligned manner. Empirical results show that our lightweight 3B inserter achieves strong reasoning capabilities with significantly reduced latency, outperforming baselines in both quality and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Various explanation methods have been proposed to visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend explanation evaluation metrics, like the pointing game and area between the insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations. Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order methods like FIxLIP outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in comparing different models like CLIP vs. SigLIP-2 and ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16.</p></details> | Preprint |

Despite impressive advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework (mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks. Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for knowledge-based VQA.</p></details> |  |

Recent works mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12 FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

By learning from hundreds of millions of natural protein sequences, protein understanding and design capabilities emerge. Recent works have shown that scaling these models improves structure prediction, but does not seem to improve mutation understanding and representation quality for protein function prediction. We introduce PoET-2, a multimodal, retrieval-augmented protein foundation model that incorporates in-context learning of family-specific evolutionary constraints with optional structure conditioning to learn generative distributions over protein sequences. PoET-2 uses a hierarchical transformer encoder that is equivariant to sequence context ordering and a dual decoder architecture with both causal and masked language modeling objectives, allowing PoET-2 to operate in both fully generative and bidirectional representation learning modes. PoET-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot variant effect prediction, excelling at scoring variants with multiple mutations and challenging indel mutations. In supervised settings, PoET-2 embeddings outperform previous methods for learning sequence-function relationships, especially with small datasets. This work highlights the benefits of combining retrieval augmentation with multimodal, family-centric modeling for advancing protein foundation models.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1 improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/cilabuniba/artseek.</p></details> |  |

Recent work leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to tackle this task. However, their large parameter size results in high training costs and low inference efficiency. To address this, we propose PUMA: a Layer-Pruned Language Model for Efficient Unified Multimodal Retrieval with Modality-Adaptive Learning. Our approach improves UMR from both structural and learning perspectives. (1) Structurally, we propose Layer-Pruned Self-Distillation, which prunes MLLMs by keeping only shallow layers while distilling features from dropped deep layers as teacher signals. This reduces parameters and preserves representation capability. (2) On the learning side, we introduce Modality-Adaptive Contrastive Learning Loss (MAC-Loss), which separates in-batch negatives into harder intra-modality and easier inter-modality groups based on the target modality, assigning different temperature strategies to enhance learning efficiency. Experiments show our method significantly reduces resource usage while maintaining strong performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

However, existing vision-language models, such as CLIP, face key challenges in e-commerce recommendation systems: 1) Weak object-level alignment, where global image embeddings fail to capture fine-grained product attributes, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance; 2) Ambiguous textual representations, where product descriptions often lack contextual clarity, affecting cross-modal matching; and 3) Domain mismatch, as generic vision-language models may not generalize well to e-commerce-specific data. To address these limitations, we propose a framework, VL-CLIP, that enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and an LLM-based agent for generating enriched text embeddings. Visual Grounding refines image representations by localizing key products, while the LLM agent enhances textual features by disambiguating product descriptions. Our approach significantly improves retrieval accuracy, multimodal retrieval effectiveness, and recommendation quality across tens of millions of items on one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the U.S., increasing CTR by 18.6%, ATC by 15.5%, and GMV by 4.0%. Additional experimental results show that our framework outperforms vision-language models, including CLIP, FashionCLIP, and GCL, in both precision and semantic alignment, demonstrating the potential of combining object-aware visual grounding and LLM-enhanced text representation for robust multimodal recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RecSys 2025; DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3705328.3748064</p></details> |

Despite their success, the mechanisms underlying their retrieval capabilities remain largely unexplored, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance and limited generalization ability. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive study aimed at uncovering the key factors that drive effective embedding learning for UMR using MLLMs. We begin by implementing a general MLLM-based embedding learning pipeline, and systematically analyze the primary contributors to high-performing universal retrieval systems. Based on this, we explore various aspects of the details in embedding generation and training strategies, including progressive transition, hard negative mining and re-ranker distillation. Notably, our findings reveal that often-overlooked factors can have a substantial impact on model performance. Building on these discoveries, we introduce a unified framework termed U-MARVEL (\textbf{U}niversal \textbf{M}ultimod\textbf{A}l \textbf{R}etrie\textbf{V}al via \textbf{E}mbedding \textbf{L}earning), which outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on the M-BEIR benchmark by a large margin in supervised settings, and also exihibits strong zero-shot performance on several tasks such as composed image retrieval and text-to-video retrieval.

This work presents the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs, including LLaVA-1.5 and LLaMA 3.2-Vision, on the textbook question answering (TQA) task using the CK12-QA dataset. We introduce a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to simulate real-world learning by providing relevant lesson paragraphs and diagrams as context. Our zero-shot experiments reveal a critical trade-off: while retrieved context improves LLaVA's performance on text-based questions, it significantly degrades the accuracy of the more powerful LLaMA 3.2-Vision on diagram-based tasks, dropping its validation accuracy from 74.07% to 25.93%. We term this statistically significant phenomenon "catastrophic context interference." Furthermore, fine-tuning highlights architectural differences: LLaMA 3.2-Vision's performance improves to 71.16% on the test set, demonstrating its capacity to learn multimodal integration, whereas LLaVA's performance declines, indicating challenges with generalization. Our results underscore the challenges MLLMs face in modality prioritization and context integration, providing a benchmark and pointing to key directions for developing more robust AI-driven educational tools.</p></details> | 8 Pages |

While dense text captions can achieve 75.9% Recall@5, they require expensive offline processing and miss critical visual information present in 34% of clips with scene text not captured by ASR. By analyzing query intent and predicting information needs, ModaRoute reduces computational overhead by 41% while achieving 60.9% Recall@5. Our approach uses GPT-4.1 to route queries across ASR (speech), OCR (text), and visual indices, averaging 1.78 modalities per query versus exhaustive 3.0 modality search.

Our approach leverages the NVIDIA Eagle2 Vision-Language model (VLM), modifies its architecture by replacing causal attention with bidirectional attention, and integrates a ColBERT-style late interaction mechanism to enable fine-grained multimodal retrieval in a shared embedding space. While this mechanism delivers superior retrieval accuracy, it introduces trade-offs in storage and efficiency. We provide a comprehensive analysis of these trade-offs.

Although vision-language models (VLMs) are widely used for this task, they often generate factually incorrect answers. Retrieval-augmented generation addresses this challenge by providing information from external sources, but risks retrieving irrelevant context, which can degrade the reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Re-ranking retrievals, as introduced in existing approaches, enhances retrieval relevance by focusing on query-text alignment. However, these approaches neglect the visual or multimodal context, which is particularly crucial for medical diagnosis. We propose MOTOR, a novel multimodal retrieval and re-ranking approach that leverages grounded captions and optimal transport. It captures the underlying relationships between the query and the retrieved context based on textual and visual information. Consequently, our approach identifies more clinically relevant contexts to augment the VLM input. Empirical analysis and human expert evaluation demonstrate that MOTOR achieves higher accuracy on MedVQA datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.45%.

We construct the Unified Agent Trajectory Dataset (UATD) from annotated demonstrations and states across diverse real-world scenarios. Based on this, we present GAE-Bench, a benchmark containing a large number of trajectory-based retrieval pairs. In addition, we propose GAE-Retriever, a multimodal retrieval framework that adopts vision-language models and incorporates optimized contrastive learning through a token selection and the GradCache mechanism. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets show that GAE-Retriever consistently outperforms strong baselines in retrieval recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing multimodal trajectory retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, accepted by Workshop on Computer-use Agents @ ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[CAL-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Multi-Agent Generation for Content-Aware Layout Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21934v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated content-aware layout generation -- the task of arranging visual elements such as text, logos, and underlays on a background canvas -- remains a fundamental yet under-explored problem in intelligent design systems. While recent advances in deep generative models and large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in structured content generation, most existing approaches lack grounding in contextual design exemplars and fall short in handling semantic alignment and visual coherence. In this work we introduce CAL-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for content-aware layout generation that integrates multimodal retrieval, large language models, and collaborative agentic reasoning. Our system retrieves relevant layout examples from a structured knowledge base and invokes an LLM-based layout recommender to propose structured element placements. A vision-language grader agent evaluates the layout with visual metrics, and a feedback agent provides targeted refinements, enabling iterative improvement. We implement our framework using LangGraph and evaluate it on the PKU PosterLayout dataset, a benchmark rich in semantic and structural variability. CAL-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple layout metrics -- including underlay effectiveness, element alignment, and overlap -- substantially outperforming strong baselines such as LayoutPrompter. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval augmentation with agentic multi-step reasoning yields a scalable, interpretable, and high-fidelity solution for automated layout generation.</p></details> |  |

The ROOMELSA challenge limits access to full 3D scene context, complicating reasoning about object appearance, geometry, and semantics. These challenges are intensified by distorted viewpoints, textureless masked regions, ambiguous language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks. To address this, we propose SAMURAI: Shape-Aware Multimodal Retrieval for 3D Object Identification. SAMURAI integrates CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking derived from binary silhouettes of masked regions, alongside a robust majority voting strategy. A dedicated preprocessing pipeline enhances mask quality by extracting the largest connected component and removing background noise. Our hybrid retrieval framework leverages both language and shape cues, achieving competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set. These results highlight the importance of combining shape priors with language understanding for robust open-world 3D object retrieval.</p></details> |  |

Answering questions over such content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text, tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.</p></details> | Preprint Copy |

In this paper, we study the multimodal retrieval problem, where the visual information (e.g, image) of item is leveraged as supplementary of textual information to enrich item representation and further improve retrieval performance. Though learning from cross-modality data has been studied extensively in tasks such as visual question answering or media summarization, multimodal retrieval remains a non-trivial and unsolved problem especially in the asymmetric scenario where the query is unimodal while the item is multimodal. In this paper, we propose a novel model named SMAR, which stands for Semantic-enhanced Modality-Asymmetric Retrieval, to tackle the problem of modality fusion and alignment in this kind of asymmetric scenario. Extensive experimental results on an industrial dataset show that the proposed model outperforms baseline models significantly in retrieval accuracy. We have open sourced our industrial dataset for the sake of reproducibility and future research works.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in sigir2023</p></details> |

While pooling reduces the annotation effort, it results in only partially labeled datasets. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative to reducing reliance on manual judgments, particularly in complex domains like medical case-based retrieval, where relevance assessment requires analyzing both textual and visual information. In this work, we explore using a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to expand relevance judgments, creating a new dataset of automated judgments. Specifically, we employ Gemini 1.5 Pro on the ImageCLEFmed 2013 case-based retrieval task, simulating human assessment through an iteratively refined, structured prompting strategy that integrates binary scoring, instruction-based evaluation, and few-shot learning. We systematically experimented with various prompt configurations to maximize agreement with human judgments. To evaluate agreement between the MLLM and human judgments, we use Cohen's Kappa, achieving a substantial agreement score of 0.6, comparable to inter-annotator agreement typically observed in multimodal retrieval tasks. Starting from the original 15,028 manual judgments (4.72% relevant) across 35 topics, our MLLM-based approach expanded the dataset by over 37x to 558,653 judgments, increasing relevant annotations to 5,950. On average, each medical case query received 15,398 new annotations, with approximately 99% being non-relevant, reflecting the high sparsity typical in this domain. Our results demonstrate the potential of MLLMs to scale relevance judgment collection, offering a promising direction for supporting retrieval evaluation in medical and multimodal IR tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the Third Workshop on Large Language Models for Evaluation in Information Retrieval (LLM4Eval 2025), co-located with SIGIR 2025. 9 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, their ability to represent multimodal information in the acoustic domain remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vela, a novel framework designed to adapt MLLMs for the generation of universal multimodal embeddings. By leveraging MLLMs with specially crafted prompts and selected in-context learning examples, Vela effectively bridges the modality gap across various modalities. We then propose a single-modality training approach, where the model is trained exclusively on text pairs. Our experiments show that Vela outperforms traditional CLAP models in standard text-audio retrieval tasks. Furthermore, we introduce new benchmarks that expose CLAP models' limitations in handling long texts and complex retrieval tasks. In contrast, Vela, by harnessing the capabilities of MLLMs, demonstrates robust performance in these scenarios. Our code will soon be available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

Moreover, while finetuned models are state-of-the-art on closed-domain tasks, general-purpose models like GPT-4o exhibit strong zero-shot performance. This raises questions about the trade-offs between memorization, generalization, and retrieval. In this work, we analyze the extent to which multimodal retrieval-augmented VLMs memorize training data compared to baseline VLMs. Using the WebQA benchmark, we contrast finetuned models with baseline VLMs on multihop retrieval and question answering, examining the impact of finetuning on data memorization. To quantify memorization in end-to-end retrieval and QA systems, we propose several proxy metrics by investigating instances where QA succeeds despite retrieval failing. In line with existing work, we find that finetuned models rely more heavily on memorization than retrieval-augmented VLMs, and achieve higher accuracy as a result (72% vs 52% on WebQA test set). Finally, we present the first empirical comparison of the parametric effect between text and visual modalities. Here, we find that image-based questions have parametric response rates that are consistently 15-25% higher than for text-based questions in the WebQA dataset. As such, our measures pose a challenge for future work, both to account for differences in model memorization across different modalities and more generally to reconcile memorization and generalization in joint Retrieval-QA tasks.</p></details> |  |

As robots and intelligent agents become more integrated into human life, there is a growing opportunity-and need-to offload the cognitive burden on humans to these systems, particularly in dynamic, information-rich scenarios. To fill this critical need, we present Multi-RAG, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation system designed to provide adaptive assistance to humans in information-intensive circumstances. Our system aims to improve situational understanding and reduce cognitive load by integrating and reasoning over multi-source information streams, including video, audio, and text. As an enabling step toward long-term human-robot partnerships, Multi-RAG explores how multimodal information understanding can serve as a foundation for adaptive robotic assistance in dynamic, human-centered situations. To evaluate its capability in a realistic human-assistance proxy task, we benchmarked Multi-RAG on the MMBench-Video dataset, a challenging multimodal video understanding benchmark. Our system achieves superior performance compared to existing open-source video large language models (Video-LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs), while utilizing fewer resources and less input data. The results demonstrate Multi- RAG's potential as a practical and efficient foundation for future human-robot adaptive assistance systems in dynamic, real-world contexts.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore unified retrieval methods using OmniEmbed, a powerful multimodal embedding model from the Tevatron 2.0 toolkit, in the context of the MAGMaR shared task. Evaluated on the comprehensive MultiVENT 2.0 dataset, OmniEmbed generates unified embeddings for text, images, audio, and video, enabling robust multimodal retrieval. By finetuning OmniEmbed with the combined multimodal data--visual frames, audio tracks, and textual descriptions provided in MultiVENT 2.0, we achieve substantial improvements in complex, multilingual video retrieval tasks. Our submission achieved the highest score on the MAGMaR shared task leaderboard among public submissions as of May 20th, 2025, highlighting the practical effectiveness of our unified multimodal retrieval approach.

Although computerised maintenance systems effectively detect and classify faults, tasks like fault severity estimation, and maintenance decisions still largely depend on human expert analysis. The analysis and decision making automatically performed by current systems typically exhibit considerable uncertainty and high false alarm rates, leading to increased workload and reduced efficiency. This work integrates large language model (LLM)-based reasoning agents with CM workflows to address analyst and industry needs, namely reducing false alarms, enhancing fault severity estimation, improving decision support, and offering explainable interfaces. We propose MindRAG, a modular framework combining multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with novel vector store structures designed specifically for CM data. The framework leverages existing annotations and maintenance work orders as surrogates for labels in a supervised learning protocol, addressing the common challenge of training predictive models on unlabelled and noisy real-world datasets. The primary contributions include: (1) an approach for structuring industry CM data into a semi-structured multimodal vector store compatible with LLM-driven workflows; (2) developing multimodal RAG techniques tailored for CM data; (3) developing practical reasoning agents capable of addressing real-world CM queries; and (4) presenting an experimental framework for integrating and evaluating such agents in realistic industrial scenarios. Preliminary results, evaluated with the help of an experienced analyst, indicate that MindRAG provide meaningful decision support for more efficient management of alarms, thereby improving the interpretability of CM systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Representation Alignment for Cross-modal Information Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08774v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Different machine learning models can represent the same underlying concept in different ways. This variability is particularly valuable for in-the-wild multimodal retrieval, where the objective is to identify the corresponding representation in one modality given another modality as input. This challenge can be effectively framed as a feature alignment problem. For example, given a sentence encoded by a language model, retrieve the most semantically aligned image based on features produced by an image encoder, or vice versa. In this work, we first investigate the geometric relationships between visual and textual embeddings derived from both vision-language models and combined unimodal models. We then align these representations using four standard similarity metrics as well as two learned ones, implemented via neural networks. Our findings indicate that the Wasserstein distance can serve as an informative measure of the modality gap, while cosine similarity consistently outperforms alternative metrics in feature alignment tasks. Furthermore, we observe that conventional architectures such as multilayer perceptrons are insufficient for capturing the complex interactions between image and text representations. Our study offers novel insights and practical considerations for researchers working in multimodal information retrieval, particularly in real-world, cross-modal applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are not designed for context-augmented generation, limiting their effectiveness in such tasks. While synthetic data generation has recently gained attention for training MLLMs, its application for context-augmented generation remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce SK-VQA, a large-scale synthetic multimodal dataset containing over 2 million visual question-answer pairs, each associated with context documents containing information necessary to determine the final answer. Compared to previous datasets, SK-VQA contains 11x more unique questions, exhibits greater domain diversity, and covers a broader spectrum of image sources. Through human evaluations, we confirm the high quality of the generated question-answer pairs and their contextual relevance. Extensive experiments show that SK-VQA serves both as a challenging KB-VQA benchmark and as an effective training resource for adapting MLLMs to context-augmented generation. Our results further indicate that models trained on SK-VQA demonstrate enhanced generalization in both context-aware VQA and multimodal RAG settings.

However, existing methods still face challenges, such as the scarcity of knowledge with reasoning examples and erratic responses from retrieved knowledge. To address these issues, in this study, we propose a multimodal RAG framework, termed RCTS, which enhances LVLMs by constructing a Reasoning Context-enriched knowledge base and a Tree Search re-ranking method. Specifically, we introduce a self-consistent evaluation mechanism to enrich the knowledge base with intrinsic reasoning patterns. We further propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search with Heuristic Rewards (MCTS-HR) to prioritize the most relevant examples. This ensures that LVLMs can leverage high-quality contextual reasoning for better and more consistent responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple VQA datasets, significantly outperforming In-Context Learning (ICL) and Vanilla-RAG methods. It highlights the effectiveness of our knowledge base and re-ranking method in improving LVLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/yannqi/RCTS-RAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Spotlight. 22 pages, 16 figures</p></details> |

These knowledge databases may contain sensitive information that requires privacy protection. However, multimodal RAG systems inherently grant external users indirect access to such data, making them potentially vulnerable to privacy attacks, particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs). % Existing MIA methods targeting RAG systems predominantly focus on the textual modality, while the visual modality remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose MrM, the first black-box MIA framework targeted at multimodal RAG systems. It utilizes a multi-object data perturbation framework constrained by counterfactual attacks, which can concurrently induce the RAG systems to retrieve the target data and generate information that leaks the membership information. Our method first employs an object-aware data perturbation method to constrain the perturbation to key semantics and ensure successful retrieval. Building on this, we design a counterfact-informed mask selection strategy to prioritize the most informative masked regions, aiming to eliminate the interference of model self-knowledge and amplify attack efficacy. Finally, we perform statistical membership inference by modeling query trials to extract features that reflect the reconstruction of masked semantics from response patterns. Experiments on two visual datasets and eight mainstream commercial visual-language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2) demonstrate that MrM achieves consistently strong performance across both sample-level and set-level evaluations, and remains robust under adaptive defenses.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval systems typically treat these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text, and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4 over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50% boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on LongVideoBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages.

Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which process both visual and textual data, offer an opportunity to unify perception and reasoning. However, effectively embedding precise safety knowledge into MLLMs for autonomous driving remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose SafeAuto, a framework that enhances MLLM-based autonomous driving by incorporating both unstructured and structured knowledge. First, we introduce a Position-Dependent Cross-Entropy (PDCE) loss to improve low-level control signal predictions when values are represented as text. Second, to explicitly integrate safety knowledge, we develop a reasoning component that translates traffic rules into first-order logic (e.g., "red light $\implies$ stop") and embeds them into a probabilistic graphical model (e.g., Markov Logic Network) to verify predicted actions using recognized environmental attributes. Additionally, our Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model leverages video, control signals, and environmental attributes to learn from past driving experiences. Integrating PDCE, MLN, and Multimodal RAG, SafeAuto outperforms existing baselines across multiple datasets, enabling more accurate, reliable, and safer autonomous driving.

To address these challenges, we propose Cross-source knowledge \textbf{Re}conciliation for Multimodal RAG (CoRe-MMRAG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively reconciles inconsistencies across knowledge sources. CoRe-MMRAG follows a four-stage pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric knowledge, then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint similarity assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates both to produce a reliable answer. Additionally, a specialized training paradigm enhances knowledge source discrimination, multimodal integration, and unified answer generation. Experiments on KB-VQA benchmarks show that CoRe-MMRAG achieves substantial improvements over baseline methods, achieving 5.6% and 9.3% performance gains on InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main</p></details> |

As retrieval complexity increases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However, current RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is presented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning, particularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This raises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect multimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive study of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To quantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and develop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across decoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify position bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases logarithmically with retrieval range. These findings offer both theoretical and empirical foundations for position-aware analysis in RAG, highlighting the need for evidence reordering or debiasing strategies to build more reliable and equitable generation systems.</p></details> |  |

Rerankers are typically trained using hard negative mining, whose goal is to select pages for each query which rank high, but are actually irrelevant. However, this selection process is typically passive and restricted to what the retriever can find in the available corpus, leading to several inherent limitations. These include: limited diversity, negative examples which are often not hard enough, low controllability, and frequent false negatives which harm training. Our paper proposes an alternative approach: Single-Page Hard Negative Query Generation, which goes the other way around. Instead of retrieving negative pages per query, we generate hard negative queries per page. Using an automated LLM-VLM pipeline, and given a page and its positive query, we create hard negatives by rephrasing the query to be as similar as possible in form and context, yet not answerable from the page. This paradigm enables fine-grained control over the generated queries, resulting in diverse, hard, and targeted negatives. It also supports efficient false negative verification. Our experiments show that rerankers trained with data generated using our approach outperform existing models and significantly improve retrieval performance.</p></details> |  |

Existing MRAG methods typically adopt a static retrieval pipeline that fetches relevant information from multiple Knowledge Bases (KBs), followed by a refinement step. However, these approaches overlook the reasoning and planning capabilities of MLLMs to dynamically determine how to interact with different KBs during the reasoning process. To address this limitation, we propose R1-Router, a novel MRAG framework that learns to decide when and where to retrieve knowledge based on the evolving reasoning state. Specifically, R1-Router can generate follow-up queries according to the current reasoning step, routing these intermediate queries to the most suitable KB, and integrating external knowledge into a coherent reasoning trajectory to answer the original query. Furthermore, we introduce Step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), a tailored reinforcement learning algorithm that assigns step-specific rewards to optimize the reasoning behavior of MLLMs. Experimental results on various open-domain QA benchmarks across multiple modalities demonstrate that R1-Router outperforms baseline models by over 7%. Further analysis shows that R1-Router can adaptively and effectively leverage diverse KBs, reducing unnecessary retrievals and improving both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

| **[Benchmarking Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation with Dynamic VQA Dataset and Self-adaptive Planning Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02937v5)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (mRAG) plays an important role in mitigating the "hallucination" issue inherent in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Although promising, existing heuristic mRAGs typically predefined fixed retrieval processes, which causes two issues: (1) Non-adaptive Retrieval Queries. (2) Overloaded Retrieval Queries. However, these flaws cannot be adequately reflected by current knowledge-seeking visual question answering (VQA) datasets, since the most required knowledge can be readily obtained with a standard two-step retrieval. To bridge the dataset gap, we first construct Dyn-VQA dataset, consisting of three types of "dynamic" questions, which require complex knowledge retrieval strategies variable in query, tool, and time: (1) Questions with rapidly changing answers. (2) Questions requiring multi-modal knowledge. (3) Multi-hop questions. Experiments on Dyn-VQA reveal that existing heuristic mRAGs struggle to provide sufficient and precisely relevant knowledge for dynamic questions due to their rigid retrieval processes. Hence, we further propose the first self-adaptive planning agent for multimodal retrieval, OmniSearch. The underlying idea is to emulate the human behavior in question solution which dynamically decomposes complex multimodal questions into sub-question chains with retrieval action. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of our OmniSearch, also provide direction for advancing mRAG. The code and dataset will be open-sourced at https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/OmniSearch.</p></details> |  |
| **[REGen: Multimodal Retrieval-Embedded Generation for Long-to-Short Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18880v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Short videos are an effective tool for promoting contents and improving knowledge accessibility. While existing extractive video summarization methods struggle to produce a coherent narrative, existing abstractive methods cannot `quote' from the input videos, i.e., inserting short video clips in their outputs. In this work, we explore novel video editing models for generating shorts that feature a coherent narrative with embedded video insertions extracted from a long input video. We propose a novel retrieval-embedded generation framework that allows a large language model to quote multimodal resources while maintaining a coherent narrative. Our proposed REGen system first generates the output story script with quote placeholders using a finetuned large language model, and then uses a novel retrieval model to replace the quote placeholders by selecting a video clip that best supports the narrative from a pool of candidate quotable video clips. We examine the proposed method on the task of documentary teaser generation, where short interview insertions are commonly used to support the narrative of a documentary. Our objective evaluations show that the proposed method can effectively insert short video clips while maintaining a coherent narrative. In a subjective survey, we show that our proposed method outperforms existing abstractive and extractive approaches in terms of coherence, alignment, and realism in teaser generation.</p></details> |  |

However, current retrieval methods primarily focus on surface-level similarities of textual or visual cues in trajectories, neglecting their effectiveness for the specific task at hand. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, MLLM As ReTriever (MART), which enhances the performance of embodied agents by utilizing interaction data to fine-tune an MLLM retriever based on preference learning, such that the retriever fully considers the effectiveness of trajectories and prioritizes them for unseen tasks. We also introduce Trajectory Abstraction, a mechanism that leverages MLLMs' summarization capabilities to represent trajectories with fewer tokens while preserving key information, enabling agents to better comprehend milestones in the trajectory. Experimental results across various environments demonstrate our method significantly improves task success rates in unseen scenes compared to baseline methods. This work presents a new paradigm for multimodal retrieval in embodied agents, by fine-tuning a general-purpose MLLM as the retriever to assess trajectory effectiveness. All the code for benchmark tasks, simulator modifications, and the MLLM retriever is available at https://github.com/PKU-RL/MART.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[MIRe: Enhancing Multimodal Queries Representation via Fusion-Free Modality Interaction for Multimodal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08334v3)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent multimodal retrieval methods have endowed text-based retrievers with multimodal capabilities by utilizing pre-training strategies for visual-text alignment. They often directly fuse the two modalities for cross-reference during the alignment to understand multimodal queries. However, existing methods often overlook crucial visual information due to a text-dominant issue, which overly depends on text-driven signals. In this paper, we introduce MIRe, a retrieval framework that achieves modality interaction without fusing textual features during the alignment. Our method allows the textual query to attend to visual embeddings while not feeding text-driven signals back into the visual representations. Additionally, we construct a pre-training dataset for multimodal query retrieval by transforming concise question-answer pairs into extended passages. Our experiments demonstrate that our pre-training strategy significantly enhances the understanding of multimodal queries, resulting in strong performance across four multimodal retrieval benchmarks under zero-shot settings. Moreover, our ablation studies and analyses explicitly verify the effectiveness of our framework in mitigating the text-dominant issue. Our code is publicly available: https://github.com/yeongjoonJu/MIRe</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |
| **[RAVENEA: A Benchmark for Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Visual Culture Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14462v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As vision-language models (VLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily life, the need for accurate visual culture understanding is becoming critical. Yet, these models frequently fall short in interpreting cultural nuances effectively. Prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in enhancing cultural understanding in text-only settings, while its application in multimodal scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAVENEA (Retrieval-Augmented Visual culturE uNdErstAnding), a new benchmark designed to advance visual culture understanding through retrieval, focusing on two tasks: culture-focused visual question answering (cVQA) and culture-informed image captioning (cIC). RAVENEA extends existing datasets by integrating over 10,000 Wikipedia documents curated and ranked by human annotators. With RAVENEA, we train and evaluate seven multimodal retrievers for each image query, and measure the downstream impact of retrieval-augmented inputs across fourteen state-of-the-art VLMs. Our results show that lightweight VLMs, when augmented with culture-aware retrieval, outperform their non-augmented counterparts (by at least 3.2% absolute on cVQA and 6.2% absolute on cIC). This highlights the value of retrieval-augmented methods and culturally inclusive benchmarks for multimodal understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Text: Unveiling Privacy Vulnerabilities in Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13957v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) systems enhance LMMs by integrating external multimodal databases, but introduce unexplored privacy vulnerabilities. While text-based RAG privacy risks have been studied, multimodal data presents unique challenges. We provide the first systematic analysis of MRAG privacy vulnerabilities across vision-language and speech-language modalities. Using a novel compositional structured prompt attack in a black-box setting, we demonstrate how attackers can extract private information by manipulating queries. Our experiments reveal that LMMs can both directly generate outputs resembling retrieved content and produce descriptions that indirectly expose sensitive information, highlighting the urgent need for robust privacy-preserving MRAG techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal RAG-driven Anomaly Detection and Classification in Laser Powder Bed Fusion using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13828v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Additive manufacturing enables the fabrication of complex designs while minimizing waste, but faces challenges related to defects and process anomalies. This study presents a novel multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation-based framework that automates anomaly detection across various Additive Manufacturing processes leveraging retrieved information from literature, including images and descriptive text, rather than training datasets. This framework integrates text and image retrieval from scientific literature and multimodal generation models to perform zero-shot anomaly identification, classification, and explanation generation in a Laser Powder Bed Fusion setting. The proposed framework is evaluated on four L-PBF manufacturing datasets from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, featuring various printer makes, models, and materials. This evaluation demonstrates the framework's adaptability and generalizability across diverse images without requiring additional training. Comparative analysis using Qwen2-VL-2B and GPT-4o-mini as MLLM within the proposed framework highlights that GPT-4o-mini outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B and proportional random baseline in manufacturing anomalies classification. Additionally, the evaluation of the RAG system confirms that incorporating retrieval mechanisms improves average accuracy by 12% by reducing the risk of hallucination and providing additional information. The proposed framework can be continuously updated by integrating emerging research, allowing seamless adaptation to the evolving landscape of AM technologies. This scalable, automated, and zero-shot-capable framework streamlines AM anomaly analysis, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASME ...</summary><p>ASME 2025 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference IDETC/CIE2025, August 17-20, 2025, Anaheim, CA (IDETC2025-168615)</p></details> |
| **[LLM2CLIP: Powerful Language Model Unlocks Richer Visual Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04997v4)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP is a foundational multimodal model that aligns image and text features into a shared representation space via contrastive learning on large-scale image-text pairs. Its effectiveness primarily stems from the use of natural language as rich supervision. Motivated by the remarkable advancements in large language models (LLMs), this work explores how LLMs' superior text understanding and extensive open-world knowledge can enhance CLIP's capability, especially for processing longer and more complex image captions. We propose an efficient post-training strategy that integrates LLMs into pretrained CLIP. To address the challenge posed by the autoregressive nature of LLMs, we introduce a caption-to-caption contrastive fine-tuning framework, significantly enhancing the discriminative quality of LLM outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms LoRA-based methods, achieving nearly fourfold faster training with superior performance. Furthermore, we validate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art models such as CLIP, EVA02, and SigLip2 across various zero-shot multimodal retrieval tasks, cross-lingual retrieval tasks, and multimodal language model pretraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fill the Gap: Quantifying and Reducing the Modality Gap in Image-Text Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03703v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) allow to embed texts and images in a shared representation space. However, it has been shown that these models are subject to a modality gap phenomenon meaning there exists a clear separation between the embeddings from one modality and another in the embedding space. While this misalignment is detrimental for downstream tasks such as multimodal retrieval, multimodal clustering or zero-shot classification, etc. no generic and practical methods have so far been proposed to assess it precisely and even reduce it. We therefore propose novel measures and effective techniques (spectral- and optimal transport-based methods) to achieve this goal. Extensive experiments conducted on several image-text datasets and models demonstrate their effectiveness and beneficial effects on downstream tasks.

| **[A Multi-Granularity Retrieval Framework for Visually-Rich Documents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01457v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have predominantly focused on text-based retrieval, limiting their effectiveness in handling visually-rich documents that encompass text, images, tables, and charts. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified multi-granularity multimodal retrieval framework tailored for two benchmark tasks: MMDocIR and M2KR. Our approach integrates hierarchical encoding strategies, modality-aware retrieval mechanisms, and vision-language model (VLM)-based candidate filtering to effectively capture and utilize the complex interdependencies between textual and visual modalities. By leveraging off-the-shelf vision-language models and implementing a training-free hybrid retrieval strategy, our framework demonstrates robust performance without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Experimental evaluations reveal that incorporating layout-aware search and VLM-based candidate verification significantly enhances retrieval accuracy, achieving a top performance score of 65.56. This work underscores the potential of scalable and reproducible solutions in advancing multimodal document retrieval systems.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, progress in large vision-language models has created new opportunities for multimodal retrieval. In response, we have updated the Tevatron toolkit, introducing a unified pipeline that enables researchers to explore retriever models at different scales, across multiple languages, and with various modalities. This demo paper highlights the toolkit's key features, bridging academia and industry by supporting efficient training, inference, and evaluation of neural retrievers. We showcase a unified dense retriever achieving strong multilingual and multimodal effectiveness, and conduct a cross-modality zero-shot study to demonstrate its research potential. Alongside, we release OmniEmbed, to the best of our knowledge, the first embedding model that unifies text, image document, video, and audio retrieval, serving as a baseline for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in SIGIR 2025 (Demo)</p></details> |
